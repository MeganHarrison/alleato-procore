# Documentation Audit Command

## Usage
```
/audit-docs <folder_path>
```

Example:
```
/audit-docs /Users/meganharrison/Documents/github/alleato-pm/PLANS/directory/
```

## What This Command Does

This command launches a specialized documentation auditor agent that:

1. **Scans all documentation files** in the specified directory (recursively)
2. **Verifies accuracy** by cross-referencing with actual code
3. **Checks completeness** against expected documentation standards
4. **Identifies outdated information** by checking timestamps and code changes
5. **Generates a detailed report** with findings and recommendations

## Audit Process

The agent performs the following checks:

### 1. Content Accuracy Verification
- Cross-references documentation claims with actual implementation
- Verifies code examples still work
- Checks that API references are current
- Validates file paths and dependencies mentioned

### 2. Completeness Assessment
- Ensures all required sections are present
- Checks for missing documentation for new features
- Verifies all public APIs are documented
- Confirms examples cover main use cases

### 3. Freshness Analysis
- Compares documentation timestamps with related code changes
- Identifies stale references to deprecated features
- Flags documentation that hasn't been updated recently
- Checks for broken links and references

### 4. Consistency Review
- Ensures formatting standards are followed
- Verifies naming conventions are consistent
- Checks that terminology is used uniformly
- Validates markdown structure and syntax

## Output Format

### NO NEW REPORT FILES!
The audit should:
1. **Update existing documentation directly**
2. **Delete duplicate/outdated files**
3. **Add entry to `AUDIT-LOG.md` in the feature folder**

### Audit Log Entry Format
Creates/updates `AUDIT-LOG.md` in the audited directory:
```markdown
## [Date] Audit Results
- Verified Completion: X% (was claiming Y%)
- Files Updated: [list]
- Files Deleted: [list]
- Issues Fixed: [count]
- Next Audit: [date]
```

### Direct Updates
- **Fix percentages** in existing files
- **Remove false claims** from documentation
- **Delete stale files** instead of archiving
- **Consolidate duplicates** into single file

## Implementation

When you run this command, I will:

1. Launch the documentation-auditor agent with the specified folder path
2. The agent will systematically review all .md, .mdx, and documentation files
3. Cross-reference with the codebase to verify accuracy
4. Generate and SAVE comprehensive audit reports:
   - `.audit-reports/audit-[timestamp].json` (for fix-docs)
   - `.audit-reports/audit-[timestamp].md` (for review)
   - Symlinks to `latest.json` and `latest.md`
5. Display summary and next steps for fixing issues
6. Optionally create GitHub issues for tracking fixes

After audit completes, you'll see:
```
✓ Audit complete!
Reports saved:
- .audit-reports/audit-2024-01-19-093045.json (for fix-docs)
- .audit-reports/audit-2024-01-19-093045.md (for review)

To fix issues:
/fix-docs --report latest --severity critical
```

## Configuration Options

You can customize the audit with additional parameters:
- `--depth <number>` - How deep to traverse subdirectories (default: unlimited)
- `--types <extensions>` - File types to audit (default: .md,.mdx,.txt)
- `--strict` - Use stricter validation rules
- `--fix` - Attempt to auto-fix simple issues
- `--report-format <format>` - Output format: markdown, json, html (default: markdown)

## Example Command Execution

```bash
# Basic audit (saves reports automatically)
/audit-docs /Users/meganharrison/Documents/github/alleato-pm/PLANS/directory/

# Review the saved report
cat .audit-reports/latest.md

# Fix critical issues using the saved report
/fix-docs --report latest --severity critical

# Strict audit
/audit-docs /Users/meganharrison/Documents/github/alleato-pm/PLANS/directory/ --strict

# Complete workflow example
/audit-docs ./docs                          # Run audit (saves reports)
/fix-docs --report latest --interactive     # Fix issues interactively
/audit-docs ./docs                          # Re-audit to verify fixes
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

This command can be integrated into your workflow:
- Run before major releases
- Schedule weekly audits via CI/CD
- Hook into pre-commit for documentation changes
- Use as part of PR review process
