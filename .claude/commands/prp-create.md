# Create TypeScript PRP

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## PRP Creation Mission

Create a comprehensive TypeScript PRP that enables **one-pass implementation success** through systematic research and context curation.

**Critical Understanding**: The executing AI agent only receives:

- Start by reading and understanding the prp concepts PRPs/prp-readme.md
- The PRP content you create
- Its training data knowledge
- Access to codebase files (but needs guidance on which ones)

**Therefore**: Your research and context curation directly determines implementation success. Incomplete context = implementation failure.

## Research Process

> During the research process, create clear tasks and spawn as many agents and subagents as needed using the batch tools. The deeper research we do here the better the PRP will be. we optminize for chance of success and not for speed.

### 0. Procore Crawl Data & Spec Artifacts (CRITICAL for Procore features)

Before starting codebase analysis, check for existing Procore crawl data and spec artifacts:

```bash
# Crawl data location:
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/

# Key files to load:
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/crawl-summary.json  # Structured summary
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/spec/COMMANDS.md    # Domain commands
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/spec/MUTATIONS.md   # Behavior specs
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/spec/schema.sql     # Database schema
playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/spec/FORMS.md       # UI form specs
```

**If crawl-summary.json exists**, read it first - it contains:
- Stats (pages captured, commands promoted, etc.)
- List of domain commands with descriptions
- UI components (tables, forms, dropdowns, buttons, modals)
- Screenshot paths for all captured pages
- Paths to all spec artifacts

**If crawl data exists but no crawl-summary.json**, run:
```bash
cd playwright-procore-crawl && PROCORE_MODULE={feature} node scripts/generate-crawl-summary.js
```

**Raw crawl data includes**:
- **Screenshots** (`pages/*/screenshot.png`) - Visual reference for UI implementation
- **DOM snapshots** (`pages/*/dom.html`) - Actual HTML structure to replicate
- **Metadata** (`pages/*/metadata.json`) - Links, dropdowns, table structures, form fields
- **Reports** (`reports/`) - Sitemap, link graph, detailed analysis

**Spec artifacts include**:
- **COMMANDS.md** - Canonical domain commands (what operations the feature supports)
- **MUTATIONS.md** - Detailed behavior specifications for each command
- **schema.sql** - Database schema derived from Procore analysis
- **FORMS.md** - UI form requirements (may be intentionally incomplete)

**MUST integrate into PRP**:
- Use COMMANDS.md to populate Implementation Tasks
- Use MUTATIONS.md for behavior specifications in context
- Use schema.sql as starting point for data model section
- Include screenshot paths for UI components to build
- Extract form fields and validation rules from metadata
- Document table columns and data structures from DOM analysis
- Add "Procore Crawl Data Reference" section (see format below)

**Procore Crawl Data Reference Section Format**:
Add this section to the PRP with a consolidated table of all crawl files:

```markdown
## Procore Crawl Data Reference

This section contains all crawl data files, sitemap, and screenshots from the Procore feature analysis.

### Sitemap

| Page | URL | Screenshot |
|------|-----|------------|
| {PageName} | [Procore {Feature} Tool]({url}) | [View](#main-{feature}-view) |

### Crawl Data Files

**Base Path**: `playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/`

### Screenshots

#### Main {Feature} View

![Procore {Feature} Screenshot](../../playwright-procore-crawl/procore-crawls/{feature}/pages/{page}/screenshot.png)

**Key UI Elements to Replicate:**
- List key UI elements observed in screenshot
- Include layout structure, toolbars, panels
- Note any context menus or modals

### UI Components Detected

| Label | Command Key |
|-------|-------------|
| {Label from metadata} | `{command_key}` |
```

If no crawl data exists, run `/feature-crawl {feature} <procore-url>` first.

1. **TypeScript/React Codebase Analysis in depth**
   - Create clear todos and spawn subagents to search the codebase for similar features/patterns Think hard and plan your approach
   - Identify all the necessary TypeScript files to reference in the PRP
   - Note all existing TypeScript/React conventions to follow
   - Check existing component patterns, hook patterns, and API route patterns
   - Analyze TypeScript interface definitions and type usage patterns
   - Check existing test patterns for React components and TypeScript code validation approach
   - Use the batch tools to spawn subagents to search the codebase for similar features/patterns

2. **TypeScript/React External Research at scale**
   - Create clear todos and spawn with instructions subagents to do deep research for similar features/patterns online and include urls to documentation and examples
   - TypeScript documentation (include specific URLs with version compatibility)
   - React/Next.js documentation (include specific URLs for App Router, Server Components, etc.)
   - For critical pieces of documentation add a .md file to PRPs/docs and reference it in the PRP with clear reasoning and instructions
   - Implementation examples (GitHub/StackOverflow/blogs) specific to TypeScript/React/Next.js
   - Best practices and common pitfalls found during research (TypeScript compilation issues, React hydration, Next.js gotchas)
   - Use the batch tools to spawn subagents to search for similar features/patterns online and include urls to documentation and examples

3. **User Clarification**
   - Ask for clarification if you need it

## PRP Generation Process

### Step 1: Choose Template

Use `.claude/templates/prp_template.md` as your template structure - it contains all necessary sections and formatting specific to TypeScript/React development.

### Step 2: Context Completeness Validation

Before writing, apply the **"No Prior Knowledge" test** from the template:
_"If someone knew nothing about this TypeScript/React codebase, would they have everything needed to implement this successfully?"_

### Step 3: Research Integration

Transform your research findings into the template sections:

**Goal Section**: Use research to define specific, measurable Feature Goal and concrete Deliverable (component, API route, integration, etc.)
**Context Section**: Populate YAML structure with your research findings - specific TypeScript/React URLs, file patterns, gotchas
**Implementation Tasks**: Create dependency-ordered tasks using information-dense keywords from TypeScript/React codebase analysis
**Validation Gates**: Use TypeScript/React-specific validation commands that you've verified work in this codebase

### Step 4: TypeScript/React Information Density Standards

Ensure every reference is **specific and actionable** for TypeScript development:

- URLs include section anchors, not just domain names (React docs, TypeScript handbook, Next.js docs)
- File references include specific TypeScript patterns to follow (interfaces, component props, hook patterns)
- Task specifications include exact TypeScript naming conventions and placement (PascalCase components, camelCase props, etc.)
- Validation commands are TypeScript/React-specific and executable (tsc, eslint with TypeScript rules, React Testing Library)

### Step 5: ULTRATHINK Before Writing

After research completion, create comprehensive PRP writing plan using TodoWrite tool:

- Plan how to structure each template section with your TypeScript/React research findings
- Identify gaps that need additional TypeScript/React research
- Create systematic approach to filling template with actionable TypeScript context
- Consider TypeScript compilation dependencies and React component hierarchies

## Output

### File Structure
Create the following files:

```
PRPs/{feature-name}/
├── prp-{feature-name}.md      # Main PRP document (static reference)
├── TASKS.md                    # Implementation checklist (live progress tracker)
└── prp-{feature-name}.html    # Browser-viewable PRP (auto-generated)
```

### Step 6: Generate TASKS.md

After completing the PRP markdown, generate `TASKS.md` from the Implementation Tasks section:

1. Use template from `.claude/templates/tasks_template.md`
2. Extract all tasks from PRP's Implementation Tasks section
3. Organize into phases (Data Layer → API Layer → UI Layer → Integration → Testing)
4. Include progress summary at top
5. Add Session Log section for AI progress tracking

### Step 7: Generate HTML Output

Generate `prp-{feature-name}.html` for browser viewing:

1. Run the HTML converter: `node .claude/scripts/prp-to-html.js PRPs/{feature-name}/prp-{feature-name}.md`
2. Or manually create HTML with:
   - Clean modern styling (system fonts, responsive layout)
   - Table of contents with anchor links
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Collapsible sections for long code
   - Screenshot references from crawl data
   - Print-friendly styles

### Output Files

- **prp-{feature-name}.md** - Main PRP (static reference for requirements/context)
- **TASKS.md** - Live checklist (AI updates this during implementation)
- **prp-{feature-name}.html** - Browser-viewable version (auto-generated)
