## Team Structure Recommendations

### Recommended Roles

Based on the codebase complexity, here's a suggested team structure:

| Role | Count | Focus Area |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Tech Lead** | 1 | Architecture, code review, unblocking |
| **Frontend Developer** | 2-3 | UI components, pages, user experience |
| **Full-Stack Developer** | 1-2 | API routes, data integration, database |
| **QA/Testing** | 1 | E2E tests, quality assurance |

### Scaling Considerations

**Team of 2-3 developers:**
- Each developer should be comfortable across the stack
- Divide by feature area rather than technology layer
- Weekly sync meetings to coordinate

**Team of 4-6 developers:**
- Can specialize by area (Financial, Documents, AI, Core)
- Daily standups recommended
- Consider feature leads for major areas

## Task Distribution Strategy

### By Experience Level

#### Junior Developers (0-2 years)
Best starting areas:
1. **Design System & UI** - Well-defined, visual feedback
2. **Directory Module** - CRUD operations, straightforward
3. **Bug fixes** - Learn the codebase through debugging

Example tasks:
- Add a new form field component
- Improve responsive design on a page
- Fix UI inconsistencies
- Add loading states
- Write tests for existing components

#### Mid-Level Developers (2-5 years)
Best starting areas:
1. **Document & Workflow** - Feature development
2. **Portfolio & Directory** - Full features with data
3. **Financial Module** - With guidance on domain

Example tasks:
- Implement a new page with full CRUD
- Build a complex form with validation
- Create a data visualization component
- Implement search/filter functionality
- Add real-time features

#### Senior Developers (5+ years)
Best starting areas:
1. **Core Infrastructure** - Architecture decisions
2. **Financial Module** - Complex business logic
3. **AI & Chat** - Advanced integrations

Example tasks:
- Optimize data fetching strategy
- Implement complex calculations
- Architect new feature areas
- Performance optimization
- Security improvements

---

### By Feature vs. Horizontal

**Feature-Based Assignment (Recommended)**

Each developer owns an entire feature slice:
```
Developer A: Budget Module
  - /budget pages
  - budget components
  - budget API routes
  - budget hooks

Developer B: Contract Module
  - /contracts pages
  - contract components
  - contract API routes
  - contract hooks
```

**Pros:**
- Clear ownership
- Deep domain knowledge
- Less coordination overhead
- Better architectural consistency

**Cons:**
- Siloed knowledge
- Uneven workload distribution

---

**Horizontal Assignment (Alternative)**

Each developer owns a layer:
```
Developer A: All page components
Developer B: All API routes and hooks
Developer C: All form components
```

**Pros:**
- Consistent patterns across features
- Better code reuse
- Cross-feature knowledge

**Cons:**
- More coordination needed
- Slower feature delivery
- Context switching

---

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid

1. Assign **primary ownership** by feature area
2. Allow **cross-team contributions** for shared components
3. Rotate ownership quarterly to spread knowledge

---

## Recommended First Tasks

## Domain Knowledge Resources

### Understanding Procore

New developers should familiarize themselves with Procore concepts:

1. **Procore Support Documentation**
   - https://support.procore.com
   - Focus on: Project Financials, Contracts, Commitments

2. **Procore Developer Docs**
   - https://developers.procore.com
   - API reference mirrors our data model

3. **Construction Industry Basics**

| Prime Contract | Agreement with project owner | Revenue source |
| Commitment | Agreement with subcontractor | Cost source |
| Change Order | Contract modification | Affects budget and billing |
| Retention | Held-back payment amount | Financial calculations |
| Submittal | Document approval workflow | Quality control |
| RFI | Request for Information | Project communication |
| Punch List | Deficiency tracking | Project closeout |
