# General Implementation Plans

This folder contains core implementation plans that apply across all features and initiatives in Alleato OS.

## Overview

General plans document the foundational systems that every feature depends on: component architecture, database schema, testing strategy, deployment procedures, and type safety patterns.

## Plans in This Folder

### [plans-recent-updates.md](./plans-recent-updates.md)
**Purpose**: Chronological log of all recent changes and features

Track record of all feature implementations, bug fixes, and enhancements with dates, file references, and descriptions.

**Update Frequency**: After every significant feature or fix
**Use this for**: Understanding what's been built recently

---

### [plans-component-system.md](./plans-component-system.md)
**Purpose**: Phase 0 UI component library documentation

Complete documentation of all shared components: layout, forms, tables, domain components, and design system primitives.

**Status**: ✅ Phase 0 Complete
**Use this for**: Finding which component to use for a UI pattern

---

### [plans-schema-modeling.md](./plans-schema-modeling.md)
**Purpose**: Phase 2 database schema and entity modeling

Documents all database tables, relationships, migrations, and the UI-first schema design approach. Includes type generation instructions.

**Status**: ✅ Core schema complete
**Use this for**: Understanding database structure and adding new tables

---

### [plans-testing-strategy.md](./plans-testing-strategy.md)
**Purpose**: Phase 6 comprehensive testing requirements

Playwright test structure, coverage requirements, screenshot guidelines, CI/CD integration, and performance/accessibility testing.

**Status**: ✅ Infrastructure complete - Expanding coverage
**Use this for**: Writing tests and understanding testing standards

---

### [plans-deployment.md](./plans-deployment.md)
**Purpose**: Production deployment guides

Vercel frontend, Render backend, Supabase database deployment. Includes CI/CD pipelines, environment variables, and rollback procedures.

**Status**: ✅ Configured and documented
**Use this for**: Deploying to production or setting up environments

---

### [plans-typescript-types.md](./plans-typescript-types.md)
**Purpose**: Type generation, hierarchy, and conventions

TypeScript type system based on auto-generated Supabase types. Includes Zod patterns, component prop types, and type safety rules.

**Status**: ✅ Established
**Use this for**: Working with types and ensuring type safety

---

## Quick Reference

### Before Starting Any Feature

1. **Check component system** - Is there already a component for this?
2. **Review schema** - Does the database support this feature?
3. **Plan tests** - What Playwright tests are needed?
4. **Check types** - Are types generated from latest schema?

### After Completing Any Feature

1. **Update recent-updates.md** with what you built
2. **Run tests** - Ensure all Playwright tests pass
3. **Regenerate types** if schema changed
4. **Update relevant plan** with learnings

## Key Commands

```bash
# Regenerate Supabase types
npm run db:types

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```
