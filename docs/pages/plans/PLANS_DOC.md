# Alleato OS - Master Implementation Plans

This document serves as the central index for all implementation plans and architectural documentation for the Alleato OS project. Plans are organized by initiative in separate folders.

## Overview

Alleato OS is a modern alternative to Procore (construction project management software) built with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, Supabase, OpenAI ChatKit UI, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS, Auth, Storage)
- **AI System**: OpenAI Agents SDK and Codex MCP
- **Analysis Tools**: Playwright-based screenshot capture and AI analysis

---

## 📁 Plan Organization

Plans are organized into folders by initiative:

### 🎨 Design System Initiative
**Folder**: [`design-system/`](./design-system/)

All plans related to UI/UX consistency, design system transformation, and component standardization.

- **[UI Consistency Audit](./design-system/plans-ui-consistency.md)** - Phase 4 audit findings and refactoring roadmap
- **[UI Consistency Enforcement](./design-system/plans-ui-consistency-enforcement.md)** - Operational guide for systematic UI cleanup

**Status**: 🚧 Phase 3 - Refactor & Enforce (60% complete)

---

### 📊 General Implementation
**Folder**: [`general/`](./general/)

Core implementation plans that apply across all features and initiatives.

- **[Recent Updates](./general/plans-recent-updates.md)** - Latest changes, features, and fixes (updated frequently)

**Status**: ✅ Foundation complete - Ongoing maintenance

---

### 💰 Budget Implementation
**Folder**: [`budget-implementation/`](./budget-implementation/)

Plans specific to building and refining the Budget module.

**Status**: 📝 Ready for new plans

*Future plans will be added here for:*
- Budget tree implementation
- Cost code integration
- Budget vs actual tracking
- Budget modification workflows

---

### 📅 Meetings Implementation
**Folder**: [`meetings-implementation/`](./meetings-implementation/)

Plans specific to building and refining the Meetings module.

**Status**: 📝 Ready for new plans

*Future plans will be added here for:*
- Meeting list and detail pages
- Fireflies.ai integration
- Meeting transcripts and AI insights
- Action item extraction

---

## Project Philosophy

The Alleato OS implementation follows these core principles:

1. **UI-First Approach** - Build the component system first, then layer on schema-driven functionality
2. **Self-Consistency** - All pages use shared component library for unified UX
3. **Extendability** - New modules use the same underlying system
4. **Autonomous Execution** - Plans detailed enough for coding agents to implement with minimal clarification
5. **Traceability** - Every UI element maps to a component; every feature has tests

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Component System ✅ COMPLETE
Build shared UI primitives (layout, table, form components) that power all pages.

**Document**: [general/plans-component-system.md](./general/plans-component-system.md)

---

### Phase 1: Workflow & Permissions
Implement workflow states, status transitions, and permission indicators.

**Status**: Planned

---

### Phase 2: Schema & Data Modeling ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
Define database entities, relationships, and migration strategy.

**Document**: [general/plans-schema-modeling.md](./general/plans-schema-modeling.md)

---

### Phase 3: Feature Development
Build MVP feature set across project management, financial, and directory tools.

**Status**: In Progress

---

### Phase 4: UI Consistency & Refactoring 🚧 IN PROGRESS (60%)
Audit and standardize all pages to use shared component system.

**Documents**:
- [design-system/plans-ui-consistency.md](./design-system/plans-ui-consistency.md)
- [design-system/plans-ui-consistency-enforcement.md](./design-system/plans-ui-consistency-enforcement.md)
- [design-system/plans-design-system-transformation.md](./design-system/plans-design-system-transformation.md)

---

### Phase 5: Data Integration
Connect UI forms to Supabase, implement RAG tools for documents and meetings.

**Status**: In Progress

---

### Phase 6: Testing & QA ✅ IN PROGRESS
Comprehensive Playwright tests, automated QA, performance checks.

**Document**: [general/plans-testing-strategy.md](./general/plans-testing-strategy.md)

## How to Use These Plans

### For Developers
1. Navigate to the relevant initiative folder (design-system, budget-implementation, etc.)
2. Read the applicable plan document(s)
3. Follow the implementation checklist step-by-step
4. Update the plan document with progress and learnings
5. Add "before" and "after" evidence (screenshots, test results)

### For AI Coding Agents
- Each plan is designed to be autonomously executable
- Plans include specific file paths, component names, and code patterns
- Follow the checklist format and mark items complete as you work
- Add evidence and notes to the plan for human review
- Log any rule violations to RULE-VIOLATION-LOG.md

### For Project Managers
- Use this index to track overall project progress
- Each plan document shows completion status for that area
- Recent Updates section provides quick overview of latest work
- Plans identify blockers and dependencies

## Creating New Plans

### Folder Structure

When creating a new plan initiative:

1. **Create a new folder** under `docs/plans/` with a descriptive name (kebab-case)
2. **Add a README.md** in that folder explaining the initiative
3. **Create plan documents** with the `plans-` prefix
4. **Update this index** to link to the new initiative folder

### Plan Document Structure

Each plan should follow this structure:

1. **Purpose** - What this plan covers
2. **Status** - Current completion state
3. **Implementation Checklist** - Actionable items with checkboxes
4. **Evidence** - Screenshots, test results, artifacts
5. **Notes & Learnings** - Decisions made, patterns discovered
6. **Related Plans** - Cross-references to other documents

### Naming Convention

- Folders: `initiative-name` (kebab-case)
- Plan files: `plans-feature-name.md` (kebab-case with `plans-` prefix)
- Examples:
  - `budget-implementation/plans-budget-tree-view.md`
  - `meetings-implementation/plans-fireflies-integration.md`

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Updating Plans

- Keep plans current as implementation progresses
- Add new sections for significant features or refactors
- Archive completed plans to initiative folder's `/archive/` subdirectory
- Update this index when adding or removing initiatives

### Plan Document Standards

- Use markdown checkboxes for tracking: `- [ ]` or `- [x]`
- Include code examples where applicable
- Link to related files using relative paths
- Add timestamps to status updates
- Include screenshots in plan's `/screenshots/` subdirectory if large
