# Project Setup Wizard QA Test Report

**Test Date**: December 14, 2025  
**Tester**: QA Agent  
**URL**: http://localhost:3000/1/setup  
**Status**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR USE - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

## Executive Summary

The Project Setup Wizard has significant functionality issues that prevent users from completing the setup process. While the wizard loads and displays initial content, critical navigation functionality is completely broken, making it impossible to progress beyond Step 1.

## Test Results

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Wizard Loads Successfully**
   - The wizard page loads at `/1/setup`
   - No console errors on page load
   - Clean UI layout with sidebar navigation

2. **Step 1 Content Displays**
   - Shows "Cost Code Configuration" card with description
   - Other setup steps are visible as cards:
     - Project Directory
     - Document Upload
     - Budget Setup
     - Prime Contract

3. **UI Design**
   - Modern, clean interface
   - Consistent with application design patterns
   - Cards show clear titles and descriptions

### ❌ Critical Issues Found

1. **No Step Navigation** (BLOCKER)
   - **Issue**: Cannot navigate between wizard steps
   - **Expected**: Next/Previous/Continue buttons to move between steps
   - **Actual**: No navigation buttons found - only non-functional cards displayed
   - **Impact**: Users cannot complete project setup

2. **Missing Step Indicators** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: No step progress indicators visible
   - **Expected**: 5 step indicators showing current position (1 of 5, 2 of 5, etc.)
   - **Actual**: 0 step indicators found
   - **Impact**: Users have no visibility of their progress

3. **No Progress Bar** (MEDIUM)
   - **Issue**: Progress bar component missing
   - **Expected**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
   - **Actual**: No progress bar elements found
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience, no visual feedback

4. **Non-Interactive Cards** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Setup step cards appear to be display-only
   - **Expected**: Clicking cards should navigate to respective steps
   - **Actual**: Cards are not interactive
   - **Impact**: Alternative navigation method unavailable

5. **No Table Display** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Cost codes table not visible on Step 1
   - **Expected**: Table showing 354 cost codes as mentioned by agent
   - **Actual**: No table element found
   - **Impact**: Cannot view or manage cost codes

### 📸 Visual Evidence

The screenshot shows:
- Sidebar navigation on the left
- Main content area displaying 5 setup cards in a grid layout
- Each card shows an icon, title, and description
- No visible navigation controls, step indicators, or progress elements
- Cards appear as static display elements rather than interactive components

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code structure and test results, the issues appear to stem from:

1. **Component Implementation Gap**: The `ProjectSetupWizard` component is rendering static cards instead of an interactive wizard flow
2. **Missing State Management**: No wizard state tracking for current step, progress, or navigation
3. **UI/UX Mismatch**: Current implementation shows all steps at once rather than a step-by-step wizard interface

### 📋 Recommendations

**Immediate Actions Required**:

1. **Implement Wizard Navigation**
   - Add Continue/Previous buttons
   - Enable step-by-step progression
   - Implement state management for wizard flow

2. **Add Step Indicators**
   - Display numbered steps (1-5)
   - Highlight current step
   - Show completion status

3. **Create Progress Bar**
   - Add visual progress indicator
   - Update based on current step

4. **Make Cards Interactive**
   - Allow clicking cards to navigate to steps
   - Add hover states and visual feedback

5. **Display Step Content**
   - Show cost codes table for Step 1
   - Implement content for each wizard step

### 🚫 Recommendation: NOT READY FOR USE

The Project Setup Wizard requires significant development work before it can be used. In its current state, users would be unable to complete the critical task of setting up a new project. The wizard appears to be in an early development stage with only the basic UI structure in place.

**Priority**: HIGH - This is a core feature that blocks new project creation.
