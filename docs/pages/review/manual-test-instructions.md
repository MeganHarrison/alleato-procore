# Manual Test Instructions - New Project Form Columns

## What Was Changed
The following fields have been moved from JSON storage (`summary_metadata`) to proper database columns:
- **Work Scope** - Type of construction work
- **Project Sector** - Industry sector  
- **Delivery Method** - Project delivery method

## How to Test

1. **Start the dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project form**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/project-form (or your port)
   - Or from the homepage, click "Create Project"

3. **Fill out the form** with test data:
   - Project Name: "Test New Columns"
   - Required fields: Street Address, City, Total Value, Start Date, Completion Date
   
4. **Test the new dropdowns**:
   - **Work Scope**: Select "Ground-Up Construction" or any other option
   - **Project Sector**: Select "Commercial" or any other option
   - **Delivery Method**: Select "Design-Build" or any other option

5. **Submit the form** and verify:
   - The project is created successfully
   - You're redirected to the project page

6. **Verify in database** (optional):
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > projects
   - Find your new project
   - Check that `work_scope`, `project_sector`, and `delivery_method` columns have the values you selected
   - These should NOT be in the `summary_metadata` JSON anymore

## Expected Results
✅ Form displays all three new dropdown fields  
✅ Dropdown options match the migration constraints  
✅ Selected values save to the database columns  
✅ No errors in browser console  
✅ Project creates successfully  

## What to Look For

**Work Scope:**
- Ground-Up Construction
- Renovation
- Tenant Improvement
- Interior Build-Out
- Maintenance

**Project Sector:**
- Commercial
- Industrial
- Infrastructure
