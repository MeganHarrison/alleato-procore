## How to Use This Data

### For Frontend Development
1. Review screenshots in `pages/*/screenshot.png`
2. Analyze component structure from `pages/*/dom.html`
3. Extract class names and patterns from `pages/*/metadata.json`

### For API Design
1. Review `SUBMITTALS-CRAWL-STATUS.md` for endpoint recommendations
2. Analyze link patterns in `reports/link-graph.json`
3. Study URL structures for REST design

### For Database Design
1. See schema suggestions in `SUBMITTALS-CRAWL-STATUS.md`
2. Review form fields from settings pages
3. Analyze data relationships from UI structure

## Re-running the Crawl

- [Submittals API Reference](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/submittals)

## Notes

- The test project has no existing submittals, so the list view shows empty state
- Some legacy URLs (e.g., `/submittals/new`) return 404 - use dropdown actions instead
- Full workflow capture requires existing submittals with active workflows
