### ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **Authentication Integration:** Auth file generation inconsistent

3. **Selector Configuration:** Form field selectors need refinement  
4. **Modal Triggers:** Modal form testing needs page navigation setup

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Fix Auth Setup** - Resolve Playwright auth file generation
2. **Route Audit** - Verify all 28 forms have working routes
3. **Update Test Configs** - Fix selectors and routes in `form-test-configs.ts`

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Route Verification** - Test each route manually
2. **Update Form Inventory** - Mark actual status of each form
3. **Fix Failing Forms** - Address auth and routing issues
4. **Expand Test Coverage** - Add remaining 14 forms to test config
