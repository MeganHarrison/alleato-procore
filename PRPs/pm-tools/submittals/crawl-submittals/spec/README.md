# SUBMITTALS Spec

This folder contains all generated specification artifacts for the
**submittals** Procore module.

## Files

- `COMMANDS.md` — Domain command reference
- `FORMS.md` — UI form requirements
- `schema.sql` — Authoritative database schema

All files are auto-generated and safe to regenerate.

## Implementation Plan

For the comprehensive implementation plan, run `/prp-create submittals`
which generates a full PRP with HTML output at `PRPs/submittals/`.
