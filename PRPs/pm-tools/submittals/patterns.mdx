# Submittals Patterns & Pitfalls

Purpose: capture recurring mistakes and their fixes so they do not reappear. Every fix must add a guard (test or lint) and be logged here with evidence.

Entry format:
- Problem: concise description of the issue.
- Before: short snippet/behavior.
- After: corrected snippet/behavior.
- Rule: how to avoid this class of bug.
- Guard: test name/path or tool that enforces it; include expected failure reason.
- Date/Author: YYYY-MM-DD, name.

Known patterns:
- (placeholder) Add the first real entry after the initial implementation pass. Prioritize: consistent Next.js route params for submittals pages, Supabase RLS alignment with generated types, and UI filter behavior matching crawled states.

When adding a new entry, also:
- Update the relevant ActionPlan Validation section to mention the guard test.
- Reference this file in any new plan’s Context section so implementers read it first.
