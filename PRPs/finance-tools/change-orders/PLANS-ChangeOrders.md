# Change Orders Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
The Change Orders management system enables users to create, review, approve, and track change orders across multiple contract types (Commitment and Prime Contract). Based on comprehensive analysis of Procore's implementation and current system capabilities, this plan outlines a phased approach to deliver a production-ready change orders tool.

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage:** Target 85%+ (Current: 0%)
- **Performance:** <2s page load (Current: Unknown)
- **Security:** Zero critical vulnerabilities (Current: Not assessed)
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (Current: Not assessed)
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge latest 2 versions (Current: Not tested)

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas:**
1. **Multi-tier Approval Workflow** - Complex business logic, potential edge cases
2. **PDF Generation** - Performance impact with large documents
3. **Email Notifications** - Delivery reliability, spam concerns
4. **File Attachments** - Storage limits, security scanning

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing for approval workflows
- PDF generation optimization and caching
- Email service redundancy and monitoring
- File upload validation and virus scanning

### Dependencies
- **External Services:** Email provider (SendGrid/AWS SES), PDF generation library
- **Internal Systems:** User management, project access controls, budget integration
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with proper indexing strategy

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Package-Based Organization:** Following Procore's model for grouping related change orders
2. **Multi-Tier Approvals:** Configurable workflow supporting 1-4 approval tiers
3. **Audit Trail:** Complete change history for compliance requirements
4. **File Storage:** Supabase Storage for attachments with security policies
5. **PDF Generation:** Server-side rendering for consistent formatting

### User Experience Flows
1. **Create Change Order:** New → Form → Line Items → Review → Submit
2. **Review Process:** Notification → Detail View → Approve/Reject → Next Tier
3. **Package Management:** Create Package → Add COs → Generate PDF → Export
4. **Reporting:** Filter → Export → Schedule → Share

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** All business logic components (80%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests:** Complete user workflows from creation to approval
- **Performance Tests:** Large data sets and concurrent users
- **Security Tests:** Authorization, injection attacks, file upload
