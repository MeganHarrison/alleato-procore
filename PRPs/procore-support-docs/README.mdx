## Starting Point

**Initial URL:** https://support.procore.com/products/online

This crawl starts from the main Procore online products documentation and follows all internal links to capture:
- Product documentation
- Feature guides
- Reference materials
- FAQ pages
- Tutorial content
- API documentation
- Integration guides

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

The crawler captures:
- **Screenshots** - Full-page captures of every documentation page

  - Links and navigation
  - Interactive elements
  - Content structure (headings, sections)
  - Code blocks and examples
  - Tables and data
  - Images and media

### Intelligent Navigation

The crawler:
- Follows all internal support documentation links
- Categorizes pages (product, faq, reference, documentation)
- Avoids duplicate visits
- Captures expandable/accordion sections
- Extracts code examples and tables

### 3. link-graph.json
**Page relationship mapping**

Shows how pages connect to each other:
- Outgoing links from each page
- Link categories
- Navigation flow

**Use it for:**
- Understanding user journeys
- Identifying key documentation hubs
- Planning information architecture

### 4. crawl-summary.json
**High-level statistics**

Includes:
- Total pages captured
- Total links, images, code blocks
- Category distribution
- Top pages by link count

**Use it for:**
- Quick overview
- Reporting
- Progress tracking

## How to Use This Data

### For Product Managers

1. **Start with:** [sitemap.md](reports/sitemap.md) to see all captured documentation
2. **Review:** Category breakdown to understand feature scope
3. **Identify:** Priority features from most-linked pages
4. **Plan:** Implementation roadmap based on feature dependencies

### For Developers

1. **Review:** Individual page metadata.json files for technical details
2. **Study:** DOM snapshots (dom.html) for implementation patterns
3. **Extract:** Code examples and API references
4. **Reference:** Component inventory for UI planning

### For Designers

1. **View:** Screenshots for visual reference
2. **Analyze:** Layout patterns across pages
3. **Extract:** UI components and patterns
4. **Design:** Consistent with Procore's design language

## Running the Crawler

### Prerequisites

```bash
# From the root of the project
cd scripts/screenshot-capture
npm install
```

### Execute the Crawl

```bash
node scripts/crawl-support-comprehensive.js
```

### Configuration

Edit the script to adjust:
- `MAX_PAGES`: Maximum pages to crawl (default: 100)
- `WAIT_TIME`: Time to wait for page load (default: 2000ms)
- `START_URL`: Starting point for the crawl

### Output

The crawler will:
1. Launch a visible browser window (headless: false)
2. Navigate through documentation pages
3. Capture screenshots and metadata
4. Generate comprehensive reports
5. Save everything to `procore-support-crawl/`

## What Gets Captured

### Page-Level Data
- Full-page screenshot (PNG)
- Complete DOM snapshot (HTML)
- Metadata (JSON) including:
  - URL and page name
  - Category classification
  - Timestamp
  - Component analysis
  - Link inventory
  - Interactive elements
  - Content structure

### Analysis Data
- **Components:** Counts of buttons, forms, inputs, tables, etc.
- **Article Content:** Title, headings, paragraphs, sections
- **Tables:** Headers, row counts, structure
- **Breadcrumbs:** Navigation hierarchy
- **Links:** All internal links with context and categories
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons, dropdowns, expandables
- **Media:** Images, videos, code blocks

## Expected Results

Based on typical documentation sites, expect to capture:
- **Pages:** 50-100+ documentation pages
- **Links:** 500-2000+ internal links
- **Code Examples:** 100-500+ code blocks
- **Images:** 200-1000+ screenshots and diagrams
- **Tables:** 50-200+ data tables
- **Categories:** product, faq, reference, documentation, api, integration

## Use Cases

### Feature Discovery
Use the sitemap to identify all Procore features and capabilities available through their platform.

### Implementation Planning
Reference captured pages to plan which features to implement in the Alleato-Procore integration.

### API Documentation
Extract API endpoints, parameters, and examples from captured documentation.

### User Workflows
Study the documentation structure to understand user journeys and common workflows.

### Training Materials
Use screenshots and content for creating internal training documentation.

### Competitive Analysis
Understand Procore's feature set to ensure competitive parity.

## Directory Statistics

After a typical crawl, expect:
- **Total Size:** 200-500 MB
- **Screenshots:** ~10-20 MB each (full-page)
- **DOM Files:** ~100-500 KB each
- **Metadata Files:** ~10-50 KB each
- **Reports:** ~1-5 MB total

## Maintenance

### Re-running the Crawl

To update the documentation capture:

```bash
# Remove old data
rm -rf procore-support-crawl/pages/*
rm -rf procore-support-crawl/reports/*

# Run fresh crawl
node scripts/crawl-support-comprehensive.js
```

### Incremental Updates

To capture only new pages:
- The crawler tracks visited URLs
- Already-visited pages are skipped
- New links are added to the queue automatically

## Important Notes

### Authentication
Unlike the budget crawl, support documentation is publicly accessible, so no login is required.

### Rate Limiting
The crawler includes delays to be respectful of Procore's servers:
- 2 second wait between pages
- Network idle detection
- Graceful error handling

### Scope Control
The crawler only follows `support.procore.com` links to stay within documentation boundaries.

### Error Handling
If a page fails to load:
- Error is logged
- Crawler continues with next page
- Failed pages can be retried manually

## Next Steps

### After Crawling

1. [ ] Review sitemap.md for documentation overview
2. [ ] Analyze category distribution
3. [ ] Identify priority features
4. [ ] Extract implementation patterns
5. [ ] Create feature comparison matrix
6. [ ] Generate implementation tasks

### Integration Planning

1. [ ] Map Procore features to Alleato requirements
2. [ ] Identify API endpoints needed
3. [ ] Plan database schema for features
4. [ ] Design UI components based on patterns
5. [ ] Create development roadmap

## Questions?

- **Where's the main sitemap?** → `reports/sitemap.md`
- **How do I find specific features?** → Search sitemap.md or detailed-report.json
- **Can I re-crawl specific pages?** → Yes, modify the START_URL
- **How do I export to other formats?** → Use the JSON files with custom scripts
