# PR Checklist (Evidence Gate)

Purpose: block merges without proof. Every PR must include links/outputs for the items below. If any item is missing, do not merge.

Required items
- Quality run clean: `npm run quality --prefix frontend` (paste short summary or attach log).
- Seeds executed (if applicable): command used (e.g., `SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... node scripts/seed-submittals-smoke.js`) and confirmation output.
- Playwright smoke: command, pass/fail, HTML report path (e.g., `frontend/playwright-report/index.html`). Scope should match the tool’s smoke spec.
- Verification report: path to `documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/<feature>/index.html`.
- Patterns updated: entry added to `documentation/*project-mgmt/active/<tool>/patterns.md` for any bug fixed, referencing the guarding test.
- Routing check: confirm route param names follow `.agents/rules/CRITICAL-NEXTJS-ROUTING-RULES.md`.
- Handoff note: update `documentation/*project-mgmt/shared/active-sessions.md` with latest ActionPlan path/status and report links.

Usage
- Include this checklist in the PR description and mark each item with links or short outputs.
- Reviewers should refuse merge if any item lacks evidence.
