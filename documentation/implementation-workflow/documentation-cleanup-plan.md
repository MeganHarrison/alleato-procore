rm "documentation/need to review/budget/VERIFICATION-SUMMARY.md"
```

### Phase 2: Consolidate Related Files

1. **RAG Documentation**
   - Merge `RAG-ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md` into `PROCORE-DOCS-RAG-GUIDE.md`
   - Move merged file to `docs/procore/rag-integration.md`
   - Delete both original files

2. **Component Reorganization**
   - Merge `COMPONENT_REORGANIZATION_PROGRESS.md` into `COMPONENT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`
   - Move merged file to `docs/plans/design-system/component-reorganization.md`
   - Delete both original files

3. **Budget Verification**
   - Delete redundant budget files (already consolidated in completion-reports)
   - Keep `BUDGET-VERIFICATION-FINAL-REPORT.md` in completion-reports (already exists)

4. **CLAUDE.md Related**
   - Review CODEX-QUICKSTART.md and REPO-MAP.md
   - Confirm all content is in CLAUDE.md
   - Delete both files

### Phase 3: Move Standalone Files

```bash
# Create destination directories if needed
mkdir -p documentation/docs/plans/budget
mkdir -p documentation/docs/plans/design-system
mkdir -p documentation/docs/database

# Move files to correct locations
mv "documentation/need to review/BUDGET-SETUP-REFACTOR-PLAN.md" "documentation/docs/plans/budget/"
mv "documentation/need to review/DESIGN-SYSTEM-AUDIT-REPORT.md" "documentation/docs/development/completion-reports/design-system-audit-report.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/DEVELOPER_MANUAL.mdx" "documentation/docs/development/DEVELOPER_MANUAL.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/DRIZZLE.md" "documentation/docs/development/drizzle-orm.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/EXAMPLE-API-PATTERN.md" "documentation/docs/development/api-patterns.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/MARKDOWN_VIEWER_README.md" "documentation/docs/development/markdown-viewer.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/PHASE-1-COMPLETE.md" "documentation/docs/development/completion-reports/design-system-phase1.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/README-SITEMAP.md" "documentation/docs/development/auto-sitemap.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/README-TABLE-GENERATOR.md" "documentation/docs/development/table-generator.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/TEAM_ONBOARDING.mdx" "documentation/docs/development/TEAM_ONBOARDING.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/TYPOGRAPHY_CHANGES.md" "documentation/docs/plans/design-system/typography-changes.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/budget/FORECASTING-INFRASTRUCTURE-COMPLETE.md" "documentation/docs/development/completion-reports/forecasting-infrastructure.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/budget/INLINE_EDITING_IMPLEMENTATION.md" "documentation/docs/development/inline-editing.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/commitments/SUBCONTRACT-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md" "documentation/docs/development/completion-reports/subcontract-implementation.md"
mv "documentation/need to review/commitments/SUBCONTRACT-SCHEMA-README.md" "documentation/docs/database/subcontract-schema.md"
```

### Phase 4: Cleanup Empty Directories

```bash
# Remove empty directories after all moves
rmdir "documentation/need to review/budget" 2>/dev/null
rmdir "documentation/need to review/commitments" 2>/dev/null
# Note: need to review directory itself should remain for future use
```

### Phase 5: Update Documentation Index

After cleanup, update:
- `documentation/INDEX.md` - Add new file locations
- `documentation/DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md` - Confirm structure is accurate

## Duplicate Analysis

### Confirmed Duplicates

| File in `need to review/` | Existing Location | Action |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| `vermillian-budget-import-ready2.xlsx` | `documentation/alleato-budget-template.xlsx` | DELETE - same content |
| `CODEX-QUICKSTART.md` | Content covered in `CLAUDE.md` | DELETE - redundant |
| `REPO-MAP.md` | Content covered in `CLAUDE.md` | DELETE - redundant |

### Near-Duplicates (Content Overlap)

| File | Overlaps With | Resolution |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Budget verification files (6) | `BUDGET-VERIFICATION-FINAL-REPORT.md` | Keep final report, delete others |
| `RAG-ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md` | `PROCORE-DOCS-RAG-GUIDE.md` | Merge, then delete enhancement summary |
| `COMPONENT_REORGANIZATION_PROGRESS.md` | `COMPONENT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` | Merge into plan, delete progress |

## Validation Checklist

After cleanup, verify:

- [ ] No files remain in `documentation/need to review/` except subdirectories
- [ ] All moved files are accessible at new locations
- [ ] No broken internal links in documentation
- [ ] `DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md` directory structure is accurate
- [ ] All completion reports are in `docs/development/completion-reports/`
- [ ] All database docs are in `docs/database/`
- [ ] All plans are in `docs/plans/[category]/`

## Post-Cleanup File Count

| Directory | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `need to review/` | 35 files | 0 files |
| `docs/development/` | 18 files | 28 files |
| `docs/development/completion-reports/` | 6 files | 11 files |
| `docs/database/` | 10 files | 11 files |
| `docs/plans/` | 6 files | 9 files |
| `docs/procore/` | 10 files | 11 files |

## Notes

1. **`.DS_Store` files**: These are macOS metadata files and can be safely ignored or deleted.

2. **`.mdx` vs `.md`**: Files with `.mdx` extension should be renamed to `.md` when moved, as the project uses standard Markdown.

3. **Future Prevention**: Per DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md, files should not remain in `need to review/` for more than 7 days. Consider adding a weekly reminder to clean this directory.

4. **Binary Files**: The `.xlsx` and `.jpg` files should generally not be in documentation. Excel templates belong in a `templates/` directory if needed; screenshots should be in a dedicated `assets/` folder.
