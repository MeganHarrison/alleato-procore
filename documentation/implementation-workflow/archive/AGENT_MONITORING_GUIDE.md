# AGENT MONITORING GUIDE
## How to Update PROJECT_MONITORING.md

### 🎯 IMPORTANT: All Agents Must Track Their Work!

The monitoring dashboard at `/monitoring` displays real-time progress of all initiatives. For it to work, agents MUST update the PROJECT_MONITORING.md file.

---

## 📍 File Location

**PROJECT_MONITORING.md** is located at:
```
/documentation/*project-mgmt/PROJECT_MONITORING.md
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Register a New Initiative

When starting a major task, register it immediately:

```bash
node scripts/monitoring/register-initiative.cjs "Task Name" "agent-type" "priority"

# Example:
node scripts/monitoring/register-initiative.cjs "Change Events Implementation" "backend-architect" "high"
```

---

## 📝 Manual Updates Required

### 1. When Starting Work
Update the Progress Log section of your initiative:
```markdown
### Progress Log
- **1/9/2026, 18:30** - Started implementing database schema
- **1/9/2026, 18:45** - Created change_events and change_event_items tables
```

### 2. When Completing Tasks
Update Success Criteria checkboxes:
```markdown
### Success Criteria
- [x] Database schema created for change events tables  ✅
- [ ] API endpoints implemented for CRUD operations
```

### 3. When Facing Issues
Add to Blockers section:
```markdown
### Blockers
- Need clarification on budget integration requirements
- Waiting for design mockups for UI components
```

### 4. Activity Log Updates
Add entries to the Recent Activity Log:
```markdown
### 2026-01-09
- **18:30** - [backend-architect] Database schema implementation started
- **18:45** - [backend-architect] Created migration files for change events
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates via Scripts

Use these scripts to automatically update monitoring:

### Update Progress
```bash
node scripts/monitoring/update-progress.cjs activity "Completed database schema" "Details here"
```

### Start Agent Session
```bash
node scripts/monitoring/update-progress.cjs session-start "Working on API endpoints"
```

### Update Statistics
```bash
node scripts/monitoring/update-progress.cjs stats
```

---

## ✅ Verification Process

When you complete a task:
1. Mark it complete in Success Criteria
2. Update the Progress Log
3. The verification agent will automatically review your work
4. Check the dashboard for verification results

---

## 🎨 Status Indicators

Use these consistently:

### Initiative Status
- `Planning` - Still defining requirements
- `In-Progress` - Active development
- `Verification` - Awaiting verification
- `Completed` - Done and verified
- `Blocked` - Waiting on dependencies

### Verification Status
- ⚪ `PENDING` - Not yet verified
- 🟡 `IN-REVIEW` - Verification in progress  
- 🟢 `VERIFIED` - Passed all checks
- 🔴 `FAILED` - Needs rework

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Update Immediately** - Don't wait until end of day
2. **Be Specific** - Include file names, function names, etc.
3. **Track Blockers** - Help identify bottlenecks early
4. **Ask Questions** - Use the Questions section for clarifications
5. **Link Resources** - Reference relevant files and docs

---

## 📊 What Shows on Dashboard

Your updates appear in real-time on the monitoring dashboard:

- **Initiative Cards** - Show status, progress, and verification state
- **Activity Feed** - Recent updates from all agents
- **AI Insights** - Bottlenecks and optimization suggestions
- **Task Management** - TodoWrite integration
- **Notifications** - Verification results and alerts

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Not registering initiatives at start
2. ❌ Updating only at task completion
3. ❌ Forgetting to update Progress Log
4. ❌ Not documenting blockers
5. ❌ Skipping verification status updates

---

## 📋 Example Initiative Update

```markdown
### Progress Log
