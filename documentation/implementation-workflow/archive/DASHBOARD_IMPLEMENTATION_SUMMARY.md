## 💡 ADVANCED FEATURES

### **AI Analysis Engine**
The dashboard includes a sophisticated AI analysis system that:

1. **Analyzes Patterns** - Detects recurring verification failures or workflow bottlenecks
2. **Provides Recommendations** - Suggests concrete actions like "Re-evaluate priorities using impact vs effort matrix"
3. **Tracks Metrics** - Shows confidence levels, impact assessment, and effort estimates
4. **Predicts Outcomes** - Forecasts sprint completion based on current velocity
5. **Categorizes Insights** - Groups findings by type (bottleneck, optimization, risk, opportunity, pattern, prediction)

### **Smart Notifications**
- **Verification failures** trigger actionable notifications with "Review" buttons
- **Task completions** show success notifications with verification status
- **System health changes** provide immediate alerts
- **Agent activity** keeps you informed of who's working on what
