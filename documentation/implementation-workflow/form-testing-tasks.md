# Form Testing Follow-Up Tasks

- [x] Point Playwright to the correct app by running tests with `BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002`.
- [x] Update form test selectors to match live labels (e.g., use `Contract #` instead of `Contract Number`, align other fields as needed).
- [ ] Add stable `aria-label` or `data-testid` attributes on form inputs where text labels are ambiguous, then update tests accordingly.
- [ ] Re-run the full form suite: `BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002 npm run test:forms` and ensure all 137 tests pass.
- [ ] Capture and archive the Playwright HTML report for the passing run.
