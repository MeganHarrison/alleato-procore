## Task File Format

All task files follow the standardized template:

1. **Project Summary** - Brief description of the project goals
2. **Key Files & Resources** - Links to relevant code and documentation
3. **Implementation Tasks** - Categorized by priority:
   - 🔴 Critical Path (Must Complete First)
   - 🟡 Core Features
   - 🟢 Enhancements & Polish
   - 🔵 Testing & Documentation
   - 🟣 Integration & Deployment
4. **Success Criteria** - Measurable completion metrics
5. **Known Issues & Blockers** - Current impediments
6. **Questions for Clarification** - Items needing user input
7. **Progress Notes** - Chronological update log
