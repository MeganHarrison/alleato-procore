# PROJECT MONITORING SYSTEM
## Multi-Agent Coordination & Automated Verification

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08 | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Active

---

## 🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This is the **single source of truth** for all active initiatives, agent coordination, and verification processes within the Alleato-Procore project. All agents must update this file when starting, progressing, or completing work.

### Core Principles
1. **Zero Trust Verification**: No task is complete until independently verified
2. **Autonomous Operations**: All verification happens automatically without user intervention
3. **Real-time Tracking**: All agents update progress immediately
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who did what and when

## 🤖 AGENT COORDINATION SYSTEM

### Agent Registration
When starting work, agents must:
1. Register initiative in [Active Initiatives](#active-initiatives-index)
2. Create detailed todo list using TodoWrite
3. Update progress every 30 minutes
4. Trigger verification when claiming completion

### Current Agent Sessions
| Agent Type | Session ID | Current Task | Started | Last Update |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| | | | | |

*No active agent sessions*
