## WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED

We have created a complete, production-ready implementation specification for the **Budget Tool** with 4 phases:

1. **Phase 1A: Budget Modifications System** (12 hours)
   - Database schema for budget modifications workflow
   - API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Status workflow: draft → pending → approved/rejected → void
   - UI components for creating/managing modifications

2. **Phase 1B: Cost Actuals Integration** (10 hours)
   - Database schema for direct costs and commitments
   - API endpoints for cost aggregation
   - Cost source differentiation:
     - Job to Date Cost Detail (includes all approved direct costs + subcontractor invoices)
     - Direct Costs (excludes subcontractor invoices)
     - Pending Cost Changes (uncommitted commitments)
   - Real cost data flowing into budget calculations

3. **Phase 1C: Project Status Snapshots** (14 hours)
   - Point-in-time budget captures
   - Snapshot comparison functionality
   - Historical variance tracking
   - Database schema for snapshot storage and retrieval

4. **Phase 2: Forecasting Engine** (20 hours)
   - Estimated Cost at Completion (EAC) calculations
   - Four forecast methods: LinearTrend, BurnRate, CommittedBased, Manual
   - Scenario analysis: Optimistic, Base, Pessimistic, Risk-Adjusted
   - Confidence level calculations
   - Trend analysis and variance projections

5. **Phase 3: Budget Variance Analysis & Reporting** (18 hours)
   - Variance identification and categorization
   - Variance driver analysis (Schedule, Productivity, Cost, Scope, Risk)
   - Alert generation for critical variances
   - Custom report generation and export
   - Executive-level dashboards

6. **Phase 4: Change History & Audit Trail** (16 hours)
   - Complete change tracking and reversal capability
   - Multi-level approval workflows
   - Before/after snapshots for all changes
   - Audit logging for compliance
   - Change impact analysis

## THE PROCESS WE USED

For each phase, we followed this exact methodology:

### Step 1: Hover Over Procore Column Headers
- Navigate to the live Procore tool page
- Hover over each column header to reveal tooltips
- Screenshot the tooltips showing:
  - What data is displayed
  - How it's calculated
  - What sources feed into it
  - Any special rules or statuses

### Step 2: Identify Data Sources
From tooltips and page exploration, we identified:
- Which tables/columns are required
- Cost aggregation logic
- Status/workflow definitions
- Dependencies between features

### Step 3: Create Comprehensive Specifications
For each phase, we documented:
- **Database Schema:** Complete table structures with relationships and indexes
- **API Endpoints:** 5-8 endpoints per phase with request/response examples
- **Backend Logic:** Formulas, calculations, and business rules
- **UI Components:** 4-5 components per phase with visual specifications
- **Testing Requirements:** Unit, integration, and E2E test scenarios
- **Implementation Checklist:** Step-by-step tasks

### Step 4: Format for AI Agent (Claude Code)
All specifications use:
- Copy-paste ready format
- Plain text + markdown versions
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Sample test data
- Error handling specifications

## HOW TO APPLY THIS TO A NEW TOOL

### For Direct Costs Tool:

1. **Navigate to the tool:**
   - Support Documentation: https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/direct-costs#chapt2
   - Live App: https://us02.procore.com/562949954728542/project/direct_costs

2. **Gather Requirements:**
   - Take a screenshot of the main interface
   - Hover over each column header to capture tooltips explaining calculations
   - Note all visible columns and their purposes
   - Identify what data is editable vs. read-only

3. **Understand the Data Model:**
   - What are the core entities? (Cost items, cost codes, vendors, line items, etc.)
   - What statuses exist? (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Invoiced, Rejected, etc.)
   - How do costs flow through the system?
   - What approvals are required?

4. **Identify Integration Points:**
   - How does this tool integrate with Budget?
   - How does it integrate with Commitments (subcontracts/POs)?
   - How does it integrate with Timesheets?
   - How does it feed into Variance Analysis?

5. **Follow the Same 4-Phase Structure:**

   **Phase 1A:** Core functionality
   - CRUD operations for primary entities
   - Status workflow
   - Basic calculations

   **Phase 1B:** Integration
   - Connect to related tools
   - Aggregate data
   - Calculate totals

   **Phase 1C:** Reporting
   - Snapshots or history
   - Comparisons
   - Export capabilities

   **Phase 2:** Advanced Features
   - Forecasting or predictions
   - Trend analysis
   - What-if scenarios

6. **Generate Copy-Paste Specifications:**
   - Create separate markdown files for each phase
   - Include database schema, API endpoints, UI components
   - Use same format as Budget tool specs
   - Provide plain text + markdown versions

## KEY INSIGHT: COLUMN TOOLTIP METHOD

The breakthrough was asking Procore users to **hover over column headers** to reveal tooltips. These tooltips contain:

- **Source Column:** Where the data comes from
- **Calculation:** Exact formula used
- **Dependencies:** What other fields it depends on
- **Statuses:** What values are included/excluded
- **Rules:** Special business logic

This tooltip information is **the specification**. It tells you exactly:
1. What database columns you need
2. How to calculate derived fields
3. What filtering/aggregation is required
4. What status values matter

## TEMPLATE FOR NEW TOOL ANALYSIS

When analyzing a new tool, use this conversation starter:
```
I have documentation and live access to a Procore [TOOL_NAME] tool.

Documentation: [SUPPORT_LINK]
Live App: [LIVE_APP_LINK]

I need you to create a comprehensive implementation specification for this tool, similar to what we did for the Budget Tool. The specification should include:

1. Four phases (1A, 1B, 1C, 2) for phased implementation
2. Database schemas with relationships
3. API endpoints (5-8 per phase) with request/response examples
4. Backend logic and calculations
5. UI components (4-5 per phase)
6. Testing requirements
7. Implementation checklists

CRITICAL: First, I'll navigate to the live app and hover over column headers to reveal their tooltips. These tooltips explain the calculations. I'll share what I find, and you'll use that information to inform the specifications.

Approach:
1. I'll provide screenshots/descriptions of column tooltips
2. You'll identify required database tables and calculations
3. You'll create phase specifications in copy-paste ready format
4. Each phase will have both plain text and markdown versions
5. Format for handoff to Claude Code (AI agent)

Ready to proceed?
```
