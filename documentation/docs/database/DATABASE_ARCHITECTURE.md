## Overview

The Alleato-Procore financial management system is built on a comprehensive PostgreSQL database that manages all aspects of construction project financials. The system tracks money flow from initial budgeting through prime contracts, commitments to subcontractors, change management, direct costs, and owner invoicing.

### Key Design Principles

- **Project-Centric**: All financial data is organized by `project_id`
- **Cost Code Based**: Financial tracking uses standardized cost codes and cost types
- **Audit Trail**: History tables maintain complete change logs
- **Status Tracking**: Most entities have status fields for workflow management
- **Temporal Data**: Created/updated timestamps on all tables

## Data Flow Patterns

### Budgeting to Cost Tracking

```
project_budget_codes
    ↓
budget_lines (original_amount)
    ↓ (modified by)
budget_modifications → budget_mod_lines
    ↓ (tracked in)
budget_line_history
```

### Revenue Flow (Owner Side)

```
contracts (original_contract_amount)
    ↓
prime_contract_sovs (breakdown)
    ↓
owner_invoices → owner_invoice_line_items
    ↓
payments_received (updated on contract)
```

### Cost Flow (Subcontractor Side)

```
commitments (contract_amount)
    ↓ (modified by)
commitment_changes
    ↓ (charges budget)
budget_lines
```

### Change Management Flow

```
change_events (identified change)
    ↓
change_event_line_items (cost estimates)
    ↓
prime_potential_change_orders (owner negotiation)
    ↓ (approved)
prime_contract_change_orders (revenue impact)
    AND/OR
change_orders → change_order_lines (budget impact)
```

### Direct Costs Flow

```
direct_costs OR direct_cost_line_items
    ↓
cost_codes
    ↓ (charges)
budget_lines
```

## Business Logic & Workflows

### Budget Lifecycle

1. **Setup**: Create `budget_lines` with `original_amount` for each cost code/type combination
2. **Baseline**: Lock in the approved budget
3. **Modifications**: Use `budget_modifications` to adjust baseline after approval
4. **Tracking**: Monitor actuals via commitments, direct costs, and change orders
5. **History**: All changes logged in `budget_line_history`

### Contract Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Create `contracts` record with `original_contract_amount`
2. **SOV**: Define `prime_contract_sovs` line items
3. **Execution**: Mark contract as `executed`
4. **Billing**: Generate `owner_invoices` based on SOV progress
5. **Changes**: Track changes via `prime_contract_change_orders`
6. **Completion**: Mark substantial and actual completion dates

### Change Order Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Create `change_events` to identify scope changes
2. **Estimation**: Add `change_event_line_items` with ROM costs
3. **Owner Negotiation**: Create `prime_potential_change_orders` (PCOs)
4. **Approval**: Convert approved PCOs to `prime_contract_change_orders` (PCCOs)
5. **Budget Impact**: Create internal `change_orders` to adjust budget
6. **Execution**: Apply approved change order lines to `budget_lines`

### Commitment Lifecycle

1. **Bidding**: Identify work package and solicit bids
2. **Award**: Create `commitments` with `contract_amount`
3. **Execution**: Mark as `executed`
4. **Changes**: Track via `commitment_changes`
5. **Payment**: Process subcontractor invoices (handled in separate payment system)

### Direct Cost Lifecycle

1. **Incurrence**: Purchase materials or services
2. **Entry**: Create `direct_cost_line_items` with details
3. **Review**: Validate cost against invoice
4. **Approval**: Set `approved` flag and record approver
5. **Impact**: Cost reduces available budget in reports

### Invoice Lifecycle

1. **Period Close**: Determine billing period end
2. **Invoice Creation**: Create `owner_invoices` for the period
3. **Line Items**: Add `owner_invoice_line_items` based on SOV progress
4. **Review**: Internal review before submission
5. **Submission**: Mark as submitted to owner
6. **Approval**: Owner approves invoice
7. **Payment**: Receive payment and update contract totals

## Key Metrics and Calculations

### Budget Metrics

- **Original Budget**: Sum of `budget_lines.original_amount`
- **Revised Budget**: Original + sum of approved `budget_mod_lines.amount`
- **Committed Costs**: Sum of `commitments.contract_amount` + approved `commitment_changes.amount`
- **Actual Costs**: Sum of approved `direct_costs.amount` + `direct_cost_line_items.amount`
- **Budget Remaining**: Revised Budget - (Committed + Actual)
- **Forecasted Final Cost**: Committed + Actual + Estimated to Complete

### Contract Metrics

- **Original Contract Value**: `contracts.original_contract_amount`
- **Revised Contract Value**: Original + sum of approved `prime_contract_change_orders.total_amount`
- **Billed to Date**: Sum of approved `owner_invoices` amounts
- **Paid to Date**: `contracts.payments_received`
- **Remaining to Bill**: Revised Contract Value - Billed to Date
- **Retention Held**: Calculated based on `retention_percentage`

### Project Financial Health

- **Gross Margin**: Revised Contract Value - Forecasted Final Cost
- **Gross Margin %**: (Gross Margin / Revised Contract Value) × 100
- **Over/Under Budget**: Revised Budget - Forecasted Final Cost
- **Billing Efficiency**: Billed to Date / Percent Complete

## Database Design Considerations

### Normalization

- The schema is well-normalized with separate tables for headers and detail lines
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity
- Many-to-many relationships are properly resolved through junction tables

### Audit and Compliance

- All major tables have `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- History tables provide complete audit trails
- User attribution fields (`created_by`, `updated_by`, `approved_by`) track responsibility

### Performance

- All foreign keys should be indexed
- Frequently queried fields like `project_id`, `status`, `created_at` benefit from indexes
- Consider materialized views for complex financial rollups

### Data Integrity

- Use of UUIDs (strings) vs sequential integers (numbers) varies by table
- NULL-able fields allow for incomplete data during workflow stages
- Status fields enforce workflow states

---

## Extending the System

### Adding New Financial Modules

When adding new financial modules, follow these patterns:

1. **Header/Detail Pattern**: Create a header table (main record) and detail line table
2. **Project Relationship**: Always include `project_id` foreign key
3. **Status Tracking**: Include status field for workflow management
4. **Audit Fields**: Include `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`
5. **History Tables**: Consider creating corresponding history tables for audit trails
6. **Cost Code Links**: Link to `cost_codes` and `cost_code_types` where appropriate
7. **Amount Fields**: Use numeric types for all financial amounts

### Integration Points

- **ERP Systems**: `contracts.erp_status` field suggests ERP integration
- **Document Management**: `attachment_count` fields suggest document attachments
- **User Management**: User ID fields reference external user system
- **Reporting**: Financial reports query across multiple tables for comprehensive views

---

## Conclusion

The financial management database architecture provides a comprehensive, audit-friendly system for managing all aspects of construction project financials. The design supports:

- Complete budget lifecycle from planning through modifications
- Full contract management for both revenue (prime contracts) and costs (commitments)
- Robust change management workflow from events through approvals
- Direct cost tracking for non-committed expenses
- Progress invoicing and payment tracking
- Historical audit trails for compliance

The modular design allows each financial component to operate independently while maintaining data integrity through foreign key relationships and consistent patterns across all modules.
