# TASKS-FORM-TESTING

## 📋 Project Summary
Comprehensive testing framework for all forms in the Alleato-Procore system. This includes creating reusable test patterns, implementing E2E tests for critical user flows, ensuring form validation works correctly, and maintaining high test coverage across all form-based features.

## ✅ Implementation Tasks

### 🔴 Critical Path (Must Complete First)
- [ ] Fix authentication requirement issues in test configuration
- [ ] Create base FormTestHelper class with common utilities
- [ ] Set up test data factories for all entity types
- [ ] Configure proper test database isolation

### 🟡 Core Features
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test for Create Project form
- [ ] Add tests for Create Contract form with all variations
- [ ] Create tests for Purchase Order creation workflow
- [ ] Test Subcontract creation with line items
- [ ] Implement Change Event form testing suite
- [ ] Add Budget modification form tests
- [ ] Test Directory forms (Companies, Contacts, Users)
- [ ] Create tests for all modal forms

### 🟢 Enhancements & Polish
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for forms
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing (a11y)
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for form submissions
- [ ] Add cross-browser testing configuration
- [ ] Implement form error recovery tests
- [ ] Test autosave functionality
- [ ] Add offline form submission tests
- [ ] Create mobile form interaction tests

### 🔵 Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Document form testing patterns and best practices
- [ ] Create test coverage reports
- [ ] Write troubleshooting guide for common test failures
- [ ] Document test data management strategy
- [ ] Create CI/CD integration guide
- [ ] Add performance testing documentation

### 🟣 Integration & Deployment
- [ ] Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated testing
- [ ] Set up parallel test execution
- [ ] Configure test result reporting
- [ ] Create test failure notifications
- [ ] Set up nightly test runs
- [ ] Deploy test dashboard for monitoring

## 🎯 Success Criteria
1. [ ] All forms have comprehensive E2E test coverage
2. [ ] Test execution time under 10 minutes
3. [ ] Zero flaky tests in the suite
4. [ ] 95%+ form code coverage
5. [ ] Reusable test utilities reduce code duplication by 50%
6. [ ] All critical user paths tested
7. [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
8. [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## 🚧 Known Issues & Blockers
- **Issue 1**: Playwright asking for approval on test runs
- **Issue 2**: Test database cleanup between runs inconsistent
- **Issue 3**: File upload tests failing in CI environment
- **Issue 4**: Authentication state not persisting correctly

## 💡 Questions for Clarification
- **Q1**: Should we test against production-like data volumes?
- **Q2**: What level of visual regression testing is needed?
- **Q3**: Should form tests include API mocking or use real APIs?
- **Q4**: How should we handle testing of third-party integrations?
