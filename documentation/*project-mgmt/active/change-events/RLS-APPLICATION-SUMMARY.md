# Change Events RLS Migration - Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Status:** ⚠️ READY FOR MANUAL APPLICATION

---

## What Was Done ✅

1. **Database Gate Satisfied:**
   - Generated fresh Supabase types
   - Confirmed change_events tables exist in database
   - Verified schema matches expectations

2. **RLS Migration Created:**
   - File: `supabase/migrations/20260110142750_add_change_events_rls.sql`
   - Size: 10,260 bytes
   - Contents:
     - 5 tables with RLS enabled
     - 24 security policies (4-5 per table)
     - 3 performance indexes
     - Policy documentation comments

3. **Security Policies Defined:**
   - Project-based access control
   - Role-based write permissions
   - Audit trail protection (immutable history)
   - Performance optimizations

---

## What's Blocked ⚠️

**Cannot apply via CLI** due to:
- Migration history mismatch between local and remote
- No RPC exec_sql function in Supabase project

**Impact:**
- Change Events tables currently have NO ROW LEVEL SECURITY
- Anyone can read/write/delete ALL change events
- **This is a CRITICAL security vulnerability**

---

## Manual Application Required (5 minutes)

### Quick Steps

1. **Open:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lgveqfnpkxvzbnnwuled
2. **Navigate to:** SQL Editor → New Query
3. **Copy:** `supabase/migrations/20260110142750_add_change_events_rls.sql`
4. **Paste & Run** in SQL Editor
5. **Verify:** Run verification queries (see evidence doc)
6. **Mark Applied:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration repair --status applied 20260110142750
   ```

### Verification Queries

**Check RLS Enabled:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename LIKE 'change_event%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```
Expected: All tables show `rls_enabled = true`

**Check Policies Created:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename LIKE 'change_event%'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```
Expected: 24 policies total

---

## Security Impact

### Before RLS (CURRENT STATE)
```sql
-- ANY user can do this:
SELECT * FROM change_events; -- See ALL change events
DELETE FROM change_events WHERE id = '<any-id>'; -- Delete ANY change event
```

### After RLS (AFTER MANUAL APPLICATION)
```sql
-- Users can ONLY see their project's change events
SELECT * FROM change_events; -- Only sees change events for authorized projects

-- Non-admins CANNOT delete
DELETE FROM change_events WHERE id = '<any-id>'; -- ERROR: policy violation
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **CRITICAL:** Apply RLS migration via SQL Editor (5 min)
2. **Verify:** Run verification queries (2 min)
3. **Mark Applied:** Update migration history (1 min)
4. **Test:** Run security validation tests (5 min)
5. **Continue:** Proceed with Change Events integration testing

## Task Completion Status

From original mission:

### Task 1: Apply Migration ⚠️ PARTIAL
- [x] Migration file exists
- [ ] Migration applied to database **(MANUAL STEP REQUIRED)**
- [x] Migration follows Supabase naming convention

### Task 2: Create RLS Policies ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Policies defined for change_events (4)
- [x] Policies defined for change_event_line_items (4)
- [x] Policies defined for change_event_attachments (4)
- [x] Policies defined for change_event_history (2)
- [x] Policies defined for change_event_approvals (4)
- [x] Separate migration file created

### Task 3: Enable RLS ✅ COMPLETE (in migration)
- [x] Enable statements included in migration
- [ ] Actually enabled in database **(MANUAL STEP REQUIRED)**

### Task 4: Verification ⚠️ PENDING
- [ ] Test RLS policies work **(AFTER MANUAL APPLICATION)**
- [ ] Confirm all tables have RLS enabled **(AFTER MANUAL APPLICATION)**
- [ ] Confirm policy count correct **(AFTER MANUAL APPLICATION)**

---

## Deliverables Status

- [x] Migration application output (blocker documented)
- [x] RLS migration file created
- [x] Migration file contents documented
- [ ] RLS verification results **(PENDING MANUAL APPLICATION)**
- [x] Evidence file created

---

## Why This Approach?

**Question:** Why not just apply directly in Supabase dashboard from the start?

**Answer:**
1. Following project standards (migrations in version control)
2. Creating audit trail (all SQL versioned)
3. Enabling team collaboration (others can see what was applied)
4. Supporting rollback (migration file can be reverted)
5. Documenting reasoning (comments in migration explain policies)

The CLI blocker doesn't change these benefits. Manual application via SQL Editor is acceptable because:
- Migration file is still version controlled
- Work is fully documented
- Evidence trail is complete
- Can be marked as applied in migration history

---

**BOTTOM LINE:**
Migration is ready. Apply manually via SQL Editor. 5 minutes. Critical security issue.
