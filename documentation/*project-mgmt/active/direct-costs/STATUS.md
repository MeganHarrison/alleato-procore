## Next Steps

1. **Run quality check** - Verify TypeScript/ESLint pass
2. **Execute tests** - Run Playwright tests and capture results
3. **Re-verify** - Spawn verifier to confirm current state
4. **Compare to Procore** - Check UI against crawl screenshots

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Last Run |
|--------|--------|----------|
| TypeScript | NOT RUN | - |
| ESLint | NOT RUN | - |
| Playwright Tests | NOT RUN | - |
| Procore Parity | Unknown | - |

## Blockers

| Blocker | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| None | - | No known blockers |

**Current Status:** CLEAR

## Notes

- Migrated to new `/implement-feature` workflow on 2026-01-10
- Significant implementation exists from previous sessions
- Needs fresh verification to confirm current state
- Old CLAUDE.md workflow file still exists (can be deleted after validation)
