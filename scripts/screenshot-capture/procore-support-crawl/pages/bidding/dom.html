If you've been invited to bid on a project, you'll receive an email from Procore with 'Invitation to Bid' included in the subject name. This email shows relevant information about the bid and is also where you can download bid documents, state whether you intend to bid, and start the bid submission process.\n\nLet's take a look at this example bid invitation email.\n\nHere we can see the name of the company inviting us to bid and the name of the project that the bid is for.\n\nThe due date of the bid, if determined, is shown above.\n\nIf we scroll down, we can learn more details about the bid, such as the bid package name, bid form name, and general information about the project in Procore.\n\nWe're also provided with the name and contact information of the person who sent the bid invitation in case we need to contact them directly.\n\nThe line items of the bid form are listed out in this section. We'll see a brief description if included along with the type of response requested for each item, such as Amount.\n\nIf the bid solicitor has included alternates on the bid sheet, they'll be shown under Alternates.\n\nIf we want to open the bid in Procore now, we can click this link here, or we can always click the View in Procore button here.\n\nLet's see a couple of other actions we can take from the email. If the company has included files with the bid package, such as relevant spec sections, drawings, and documents, we can go ahead and download them in a .zip file by clicking the Download button here. If we want to indicate whether or not we intend to bid on the project, we can submit our response here.\n\nNote that we can change this response before the due date if needed. Now let's go over how to submit our bid in Procore.\n\nIf you prefer to submit your bid via email without logging into Procore, you can reply directly to the bid invitation email with one or more files attached.\n\nAfter you send the email, the bid solicitor will see that you submitted a bid and can review the files that were attached to your email.\n\nLet's go ahead and click View in Procore to see how we can submit our bid through Procore's web application.\n\nNote that if this is your first time being added to Procore, you should receive a welcome to Procore email with a link to get started. The email address used for your bid invitation will be your username, and you'll need to create a secure password to log in with.\n\nIf we've been added to Procore before, we can go ahead and log in now.\n\nAfter logging in, we'll see the company's Planroom tool in Procore where we can review the bid sheet and related information, such as bid documents and emails. We see the same information that was listed on the email and have options to download or email the bid documents from the bid package, specify or change our intention to bid, and export the bid sheet. If we have questions for the bid solicitor, we can click the Contact button here to start an email, or go to the Emails tab to review any emails related to the bid. If the bid solicitor sends out an addendum or other change as a correspondence, it will show on the Correspondence tab.\n\nWhen we're ready to place our bid, we'll click Enter a Bid.\n\nWe can then enter an amount for each line item, and Procore will automatically calculate the total.\n\nIf we want to provide alternates, we can enter them here.\n\nIf we have any inclusions, exclusions, or comments, we can write them out in these sections.\n\nTo attach any supporting documents, we can go ahead and upload files to the Attachments section. If we're not ready to submit the bid yet, we can click Save for Later and return to the bid another time.\n\nWhen we are ready to officially submit the bid, we'll click Submit Bid.\n\nA message confirms that we've successfully submitted our bid, and the bid solicitor will be notified of our bid submission.\n\nIf they decide to award our bid and convert it to a contract in Procore, we'll receive an awarded contract email. Note that if we need to change anything on the bid before the due date passes, we can log back into Procore and click Edit to revise and resubmit our bid.\n\nFor additional resources on submitting a bid, check out the instructions for bidding section of the bid invitation email. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/bidding?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1168">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wss0v45gbw","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT1M55S","name":"Documents: Upload Bid Documents","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/135c3e853bbee8b6b32708e7a15b7270.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wss0v45gbw","uploadDate":"2020-10-20T20:50:18.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: Product Cert (en-us) video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/cf1f66dda9d8e0f6f80b06155dd9dba4282409d9.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we're going to go over how to set up your bid documents in the documents tool.

You can start by clicking 'Create Bid Package'. We'll create one Bid Package for the entire project. Let's title the Bid Package with the project name, and put the number as 1 to indicate that this is the first Bid Package in the project.\n\nWe'll leave the statuses 'Open'. This means that bids are currently being accepted for this bid package. But once the bid due date has passed, or if you choose to cancel the bid, you should change the status to Closed, so that bidders no longer have access to the bid package. Now let's set the Due Date and Time by which all bid invitees need to submit their bids.\n\nFor this package, let's set it 4 weeks from today at 2pm. Let's decide if we want to add a primary bidding contact. The primary bidding contact adjusts the alias of the automated emails sent from the Bidding tool. If we select a primary bidding contact, then the automated emails from Procore will appear to be from that contact.\n\nHowever, if we want the invites to appear from Procore, then we can select 'Procore Mailer'. We can also add additional contacts to be notified when bids are submitted using the Bidding CC group. As with other Procore tools, this distribution list is a great way to keep all key stakeholders informed. Let's add the assistant project manager.\n\nThe next two fields are pulling data from the configurations we previously set in the project level Admin tool. If we want to make any modifications that are specific to this particular bid package, we will still have the option to do so at the project level. Also, if there is a pre bid site walkthrough, we can enable the RFI deadline and site walkthrough settings and add the related information. If we know when we're going to award the contracts, we can enter that date here.\n\nThis field is optional, so we'll leave it blank for now since the date is yet to be decided. If we want to send daily emails reminding bidders of their due date, we can enable countdown emails, and choose how many days from the bid due date we want to start sending daily reminder emails to encourage companies to submit their bids. Let's choose 7 days so the bidders will be sent notification emails starting 7 days prior to the due date. Another setting we can enable is Accept Submissions Past Due Date if you want bidders to be able to submit bids within Procore past the specified due date, which may be necessary if you haven't received enough bids or if you want to give your bidders more flexibility.\n\nIf we do not enable, bidders will not be able to submit any bids within Procore after the due date. If we click on Enable Blind Bidding, all bid dollar amounts will be hidden from administrators until the due date has passed, though you will still see that the bid has been submitted. This setting helps ensure ethical bid practices. Next, we can Disable Electronic Submissions of Bids.\n\nWe will want to enable this setting for projects that do not allow bidders to submit bids electronically. Let's enable Include Bid Docs so that the bidders can access bid documents directly from the bid invitation email. It's recommended that you enable this setting because it will make it a lot easier for the bidders to access the required project documentation directly from the email. In other words, bidders do not have to log into Procore to access all the bid documents.\n\nLastly, the bid submission message is pulling data from the project level admin tools configurations. If we want to make any modifications for this specific bid, we can do so at this time. Once we have entered all the necessary general information for the package, let's click 'Create Bid Package'. Now, we'll attach the Drawings, Documents, and Specifications that we uploaded when we configured our project for bidding.\n\nFor the Drawings, let's select our bid set, and we can narrow it down further by discipline, and then select individual drawings. Next, we'll attach the Documents folder we configured specifically for bidding. Remember, if you select the Parent folder, all the subfolders and files will also be attached to the bid list. We'll attach relevant sections of the bid set to our spec book.\n\nAnd if the bid package only pertains to one division within the spec book, we can choose to only attach that specific division. Once we want the bidders to have access to all relevant documentation, we're going to include both the current set of drawings and specs. Once all of our files have been selected, Click 'Attach Files'. We can now see the Bidding tab within our bid package.\n\nWe can also see the Overview, Files, Correspondence, Download Log, and Change History. Once a bid package has been created, we can build out bid forms. For more information on bid packages, visit support. procore.\n\ncom.

Let's get started. So what happens when an addendum is issued while the project is out for bid? All you need to do is update the bid package by going to the documents tool and updating the bid package folder to include another addendum.\n\nLet's upload a new addendum. Make note of the big yellow warning banner, letting me know that we've updated something within the bid package and is asking if we want to update. Now that we've updated the bid package. We'll want to inform the bidders of the update in case they already downloaded the bid docs.\n\nWe can check to see if bidders have downloaded the bid box by clicking the download log. The best way to inform bidders is via the correspondent's sub tab. We'll click add new correspondence where we can send an email notification to all bidders with updated bid information. Any bidders who have not declined a bid will automatically be in the BCC Field.\n\nWe'll add the subject addendum number too and instructions the attached link for new addendum added and click Send. They will all get an email with the updated bid doc link. Once the emails have been responded to and all bids have been submitted, it's time to review them and select your winning bids. We can review bids from the bidders view within this package.\n\nWe can also use the filters, like if we want to only view companies who've submitted their bid. You can also group by intent to bid, submission status, cost codes or trades. You can click into the activity log to see any status changes, downloads, notes or emails performed by each company. This is a great time to verify that the bidders have downloaded any updates like addendums.\n\nYou can also add a note to a company in the bid list. From this view you can see who has submitted a bid as well as which companies indicated their intention to bid but failed to submit it before the deadline. In such cases, you may want to contact these companies to see if they had problems submitting their bid or if they mailed or emailed their bid instead of submitting it via Procore. If your contractor bids on the package outside of Procore, you can submit a bid on their behalf.\n\nLet's say Steve chose to email his bid to Elton directly so Elton can go into the bid list, view the specific company, and submit a bid on their behalf. Once Elton has decided who has the winning bid, he can convert it into a contract.

If you've been invited to bid on a project, you'll receive an email from Procore with 'Invitation to Bid' included in the subject name. This email shows relevant information about the bid and is also where you can download bid documents, state whether you intend to bid, and start the bid submission process.\n\nLet's take a look at this example bid invitation email.\n\nHere we can see the name of the company inviting us to bid and the name of the project that the bid is for.\n\nThe due date of the bid, if determined, is shown above.\n\nIf we scroll down, we can learn more details about the bid, such as the bid package name, bid form name, and general information about the project in Procore.\n\nWe're also provided with the name and contact information of the person who sent the bid invitation in case we need to contact them directly.\n\nThe line items of the bid form are listed out in this section. We'll see a brief description if included along with the type of response requested for each item, such as Amount.\n\nIf the bid solicitor has included alternates on the bid sheet, they'll be shown under Alternates.\n\nIf we want to open the bid in Procore now, we can click this link here, or we can always click the View in Procore button here.\n\nLet's see a couple of other actions we can take from the email. If the company has included files with the bid package, such as relevant spec sections, drawings, and documents, we can go ahead and download them in a .zip file by clicking the Download button here. If we want to indicate whether or not we intend to bid on the project, we can submit our response here.\n\nNote that we can change this response before the due date if needed. Now let's go over how to submit our bid in Procore.\n\nIf you prefer to submit your bid via email without logging into Procore, you can reply directly to the bid invitation email with one or more files attached.\n\nAfter you send the email, the bid solicitor will see that you submitted a bid and can review the files that were attached to your email.\n\nLet's go ahead and click View in Procore to see how we can submit our bid through Procore's web application.\n\nNote that if this is your first time being added to Procore, you should receive a welcome to Procore email with a link to get started. The email address used for your bid invitation will be your username, and you'll need to create a secure password to log in with.\n\nIf we've been added to Procore before, we can go ahead and log in now.\n\nAfter logging in, we'll see the company's Planroom tool in Procore where we can review the bid sheet and related information, such as bid documents and emails. We see the same information that was listed on the email and have options to download or email the bid documents from the bid package, specify or change our intention to bid, and export the bid sheet. If we have questions for the bid solicitor, we can click the Contact button here to start an email, or go to the Emails tab to review any emails related to the bid. If the bid solicitor sends out an addendum or other change as a correspondence, it will show on the Correspondence tab.\n\nWhen we're ready to place our bid, we'll click Enter a Bid.\n\nWe can then enter an amount for each line item, and Procore will automatically calculate the total.\n\nIf we want to provide alternates, we can enter them here.\n\nIf we have any inclusions, exclusions, or comments, we can write them out in these sections.\n\nTo attach any supporting documents, we can go ahead and upload files to the Attachments section. If we're not ready to submit the bid yet, we can click Save for Later and return to the bid another time.\n\nWhen we are ready to officially submit the bid, we'll click Submit Bid.\n\nA message confirms that we've successfully submitted our bid, and the bid solicitor will be notified of our bid submission.\n\nIf they decide to award our bid and convert it to a contract in Procore, we'll receive an awarded contract email. Note that if we need to change anything on the bid before the due date passes, we can log back into Procore and click Edit to revise and resubmit our bid.\n\nFor additional resources on submitting a bid, check out the instructions for bidding section of the bid invitation email.

Procore's Bidding tool allows you to give bidders access to the information they need without having to send them huge files via email or using a document sharing system. Instead, everything can be managed in Procore, where you'll have a detailed and complete record of the entire bid process. Keep all parties informed at all times by making necessary changes in real time to accommodate for last minute modifications to the plans, schedule or other types of addendums.\n\nWhat's especially convenient for the bidders is that they can reply directly to the bid invitation email, declaring their intention to submit a bid for the project and download attached bid documents without ever having to log into Procore. Bidders can also upload their bid directly into Procore, or you can do it on their behalf. From there you can create a contract directly from the winning bid. Before we dove into the bidding tool, let's configure a few bidding settings in the projects admin tool under tool configuration, click Bidding.\n\nHere we can set default verbiage for our bid package if we want to defer from the default language that is inherited from an account setting at the company level. Although you can customize these text for your project is necessary, we recommend consulting with your company's project administrator to make sure you're following your company's policies and standards. However, we do recommend that you keep this portion of the default text to remind bid invitees that if they have problems submitting a bid, they can contact Procore's support team for help instead of contacting you directly. The bid\n\nsubmission confirmation message text is displayed when a bid invitee submits a bid. Let's add a confirmation message since it's blank by default. The next step is to determine where the bid invitations will be sent from, with respect to a physical mailing address. We will leave the default company for your company's headquarters and will want to select project if you have a local or regional office location.\n\nLet's click Update to save our settings. Now let's navigate to the bidding tool and review the tool specific configuration settings. If we click configure bid settings, we will see the default settings for each bid package. You can create multiple bid packages for a project, but we'll cover this in more detail in the Create a Bid Package video.\n\nYou'll likely want to configure some of your bid settings to be specific for your project. Note that the setting to enable bidders to add additional line items to their bid sheets can only be configured here. Mark this box. If you want bidders to be able to add a cost code and bid on additional scope that was not assigned to them.\n\nPlease use this setting with caution because bidders could add a cost code that is not accounted for your budget. Once your bid package settings are configured, click Update and return to the bidding tool. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/bidding?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1302">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9utdtvhgt4","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M45S","name":"Bidding: Update and View a Bid Package","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/a4ee262008faae66005d0a1477e146d5.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9utdtvhgt4","uploadDate":"2020-10-20T20:49:39.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: z_ARCHIVE video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/9401655ed4bd91e35c15ba8ab8699161044ecac8.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we're going to go over how to update and view a bid package. Let's get started. So what happens when an addendum is issued while the project is out for bid? All you need to do is update the bid package by going to the documents tool and updating the bid package folder to include another addendum.\n\nLet's upload a new addendum. Make note of the big yellow warning banner, letting me know that we've updated something within the bid package and is asking if we want to update. Now that we've updated the bid package. We'll want to inform the bidders of the update in case they already downloaded the bid docs.\n\nWe can check to see if bidders have downloaded the bid box by clicking the download log. The best way to inform bidders is via the correspondent's sub tab. We'll click add new correspondence where we can send an email notification to all bidders with updated bid information. Any bidders who have not declined a bid will automatically be in the BCC Field.\n\nWe'll add the subject addendum number too and instructions the attached link for new addendum added and click Send. They will all get an email with the updated bid doc link. Once the emails have been responded to and all bids have been submitted, it's time to review them and select your winning bids. We can review bids from the bidders view within this package.\n\nWe can also use the filters, like if we want to only view companies who've submitted their bid. You can also group by intent to bid, submission status, cost codes or trades. You can click into the activity log to see any status changes, downloads, notes or emails performed by each company. This is a great time to verify that the bidders have downloaded any updates like addendums.\n\nYou can also add a note to a company in the bid list. From this view you can see who has submitted a bid as well as which companies indicated their intention to bid but failed to submit it before the deadline. In such cases, you may want to contact these companies to see if they had problems submitting their bid or if they mailed or emailed their bid instead of submitting it via Procore. If your contractor bids on the package outside of Procore, you can submit a bid on their behalf.\n\nLet's say Steve chose to email his bid to Elton directly so Elton can go into the bid list, view the specific company, and submit a bid on their behalf. Once Elton has decided who has the winning bid, he can convert it into a contract.

You can start by clicking 'Create Bid Package'. We'll create one Bid Package for the entire project. Let's title the Bid Package with the project name, and put the number as 1 to indicate that this is the first Bid Package in the project.\n\nWe'll leave the statuses 'Open'. This means that bids are currently being accepted for this bid package. But once the bid due date has passed, or if you choose to cancel the bid, you should change the status to Closed, so that bidders no longer have access to the bid package. Now let's set the Due Date and Time by which all bid invitees need to submit their bids.\n\nFor this package, let's set it 4 weeks from today at 2pm. Let's decide if we want to add a primary bidding contact. The primary bidding contact adjusts the alias of the automated emails sent from the Bidding tool. If we select a primary bidding contact, then the automated emails from Procore will appear to be from that contact.\n\nHowever, if we want the invites to appear from Procore, then we can select 'Procore Mailer'. We can also add additional contacts to be notified when bids are submitted using the Bidding CC group. As with other Procore tools, this distribution list is a great way to keep all key stakeholders informed. Let's add the assistant project manager.\n\nThe next two fields are pulling data from the configurations we previously set in the project level Admin tool. If we want to make any modifications that are specific to this particular bid package, we will still have the option to do so at the project level. Also, if there is a pre bid site walkthrough, we can enable the RFI deadline and site walkthrough settings and add the related information. If we know when we're going to award the contracts, we can enter that date here.\n\nThis field is optional, so we'll leave it blank for now since the date is yet to be decided. If we want to send daily emails reminding bidders of their due date, we can enable countdown emails, and choose how many days from the bid due date we want to start sending daily reminder emails to encourage companies to submit their bids. Let's choose 7 days so the bidders will be sent notification emails starting 7 days prior to the due date. Another setting we can enable is Accept Submissions Past Due Date if you want bidders to be able to submit bids within Procore past the specified due date, which may be necessary if you haven't received enough bids or if you want to give your bidders more flexibility.\n\nIf we do not enable, bidders will not be able to submit any bids within Procore after the due date. If we click on Enable Blind Bidding, all bid dollar amounts will be hidden from administrators until the due date has passed, though you will still see that the bid has been submitted. This setting helps ensure ethical bid practices. Next, we can Disable Electronic Submissions of Bids.\n\nWe will want to enable this setting for projects that do not allow bidders to submit bids electronically. Let's enable Include Bid Docs so that the bidders can access bid documents directly from the bid invitation email. It's recommended that you enable this setting because it will make it a lot easier for the bidders to access the required project documentation directly from the email. In other words, bidders do not have to log into Procore to access all the bid documents.\n\nLastly, the bid submission message is pulling data from the project level admin tools configurations. If we want to make any modifications for this specific bid, we can do so at this time. Once we have entered all the necessary general information for the package, let's click 'Create Bid Package'. Now, we'll attach the Drawings, Documents, and Specifications that we uploaded when we configured our project for bidding.\n\nFor the Drawings, let's select our bid set, and we can narrow it down further by discipline, and then select individual drawings. Next, we'll attach the Documents folder we configured specifically for bidding. Remember, if you select the Parent folder, all the subfolders and files will also be attached to the bid list. We'll attach relevant sections of the bid set to our spec book.\n\nAnd if the bid package only pertains to one division within the spec book, we can choose to only attach that specific division. Once we want the bidders to have access to all relevant documentation, we're going to include both the current set of drawings and specs. Once all of our files have been selected, Click 'Attach Files'. We can now see the Bidding tab within our bid package.\n\nWe can also see the Overview, Files, Correspondence, Download Log, and Change History. Once a bid package has been created, we can build out bid forms. For more information on bid packages, visit support. procore.\n\ncom.

If you've been invited to bid on a project, you'll receive an email from Procore with 'Invitation to Bid' included in the subject name. This email shows relevant information about the bid and is also where you can download bid documents, state whether you intend to bid, and start the bid submission process.\n\nLet's take a look at this example bid invitation email.\n\nHere we can see the name of the company inviting us to bid and the name of the project that the bid is for.\n\nThe due date of the bid, if determined, is shown above.\n\nIf we scroll down, we can learn more details about the bid, such as the bid package name, bid form name, and general information about the project in Procore.\n\nWe're also provided with the name and contact information of the person who sent the bid invitation in case we need to contact them directly.\n\nThe line items of the bid form are listed out in this section. We'll see a brief description if included along with the type of response requested for each item, such as Amount.\n\nIf the bid solicitor has included alternates on the bid sheet, they'll be shown under Alternates.\n\nIf we want to open the bid in Procore now, we can click this link here, or we can always click the View in Procore button here.\n\nLet's see a couple of other actions we can take from the email. If the company has included files with the bid package, such as relevant spec sections, drawings, and documents, we can go ahead and download them in a .zip file by clicking the Download button here. If we want to indicate whether or not we intend to bid on the project, we can submit our response here.\n\nNote that we can change this response before the due date if needed. Now let's go over how to submit our bid in Procore.\n\nIf you prefer to submit your bid via email without logging into Procore, you can reply directly to the bid invitation email with one or more files attached.\n\nAfter you send the email, the bid solicitor will see that you submitted a bid and can review the files that were attached to your email.\n\nLet's go ahead and click View in Procore to see how we can submit our bid through Procore's web application.\n\nNote that if this is your first time being added to Procore, you should receive a welcome to Procore email with a link to get started. The email address used for your bid invitation will be your username, and you'll need to create a secure password to log in with.\n\nIf we've been added to Procore before, we can go ahead and log in now.\n\nAfter logging in, we'll see the company's Planroom tool in Procore where we can review the bid sheet and related information, such as bid documents and emails. We see the same information that was listed on the email and have options to download or email the bid documents from the bid package, specify or change our intention to bid, and export the bid sheet. If we have questions for the bid solicitor, we can click the Contact button here to start an email, or go to the Emails tab to review any emails related to the bid. If the bid solicitor sends out an addendum or other change as a correspondence, it will show on the Correspondence tab.\n\nWhen we're ready to place our bid, we'll click Enter a Bid.\n\nWe can then enter an amount for each line item, and Procore will automatically calculate the total.\n\nIf we want to provide alternates, we can enter them here.\n\nIf we have any inclusions, exclusions, or comments, we can write them out in these sections.\n\nTo attach any supporting documents, we can go ahead and upload files to the Attachments section. If we're not ready to submit the bid yet, we can click Save for Later and return to the bid another time.\n\nWhen we are ready to officially submit the bid, we'll click Submit Bid.\n\nA message confirms that we've successfully submitted our bid, and the bid solicitor will be notified of our bid submission.\n\nIf they decide to award our bid and convert it to a contract in Procore, we'll receive an awarded contract email. Note that if we need to change anything on the bid before the due date passes, we can log back into Procore and click Edit to revise and resubmit our bid.\n\nFor additional resources on submitting a bid, check out the instructions for bidding section of the bid invitation email.

Let's get started. So what happens when an addendum is issued while the project is out for bid? All you need to do is update the bid package by going to the documents tool and updating the bid package folder to include another addendum.\n\nLet's upload a new addendum. Make note of the big yellow warning banner, letting me know that we've updated something within the bid package and is asking if we want to update. Now that we've updated the bid package. We'll want to inform the bidders of the update in case they already downloaded the bid docs.\n\nWe can check to see if bidders have downloaded the bid box by clicking the download log. The best way to inform bidders is via the correspondent's sub tab. We'll click add new correspondence where we can send an email notification to all bidders with updated bid information. Any bidders who have not declined a bid will automatically be in the BCC Field.\n\nWe'll add the subject addendum number too and instructions the attached link for new addendum added and click Send. They will all get an email with the updated bid doc link. Once the emails have been responded to and all bids have been submitted, it's time to review them and select your winning bids. We can review bids from the bidders view within this package.\n\nWe can also use the filters, like if we want to only view companies who've submitted their bid. You can also group by intent to bid, submission status, cost codes or trades. You can click into the activity log to see any status changes, downloads, notes or emails performed by each company. This is a great time to verify that the bidders have downloaded any updates like addendums.\n\nYou can also add a note to a company in the bid list. From this view you can see who has submitted a bid as well as which companies indicated their intention to bid but failed to submit it before the deadline. In such cases, you may want to contact these companies to see if they had problems submitting their bid or if they mailed or emailed their bid instead of submitting it via Procore. If your contractor bids on the package outside of Procore, you can submit a bid on their behalf.\n\nLet's say Steve chose to email his bid to Elton directly so Elton can go into the bid list, view the specific company, and submit a bid on their behalf. Once Elton has decided who has the winning bid, he can convert it into a contract.

You can start by clicking 'Create Bid Package'. We'll create one Bid Package for the entire project. Let's title the Bid Package with the project name, and put the number as 1 to indicate that this is the first Bid Package in the project.\n\nWe'll leave the statuses 'Open'. This means that bids are currently being accepted for this bid package. But once the bid due date has passed, or if you choose to cancel the bid, you should change the status to Closed, so that bidders no longer have access to the bid package. Now let's set the Due Date and Time by which all bid invitees need to submit their bids.\n\nFor this package, let's set it 4 weeks from today at 2pm. Let's decide if we want to add a primary bidding contact. The primary bidding contact adjusts the alias of the automated emails sent from the Bidding tool. If we select a primary bidding contact, then the automated emails from Procore will appear to be from that contact.\n\nHowever, if we want the invites to appear from Procore, then we can select 'Procore Mailer'. We can also add additional contacts to be notified when bids are submitted using the Bidding CC group. As with other Procore tools, this distribution list is a great way to keep all key stakeholders informed. Let's add the assistant project manager.\n\nThe next two fields are pulling data from the configurations we previously set in the project level Admin tool. If we want to make any modifications that are specific to this particular bid package, we will still have the option to do so at the project level. Also, if there is a pre bid site walkthrough, we can enable the RFI deadline and site walkthrough settings and add the related information. If we know when we're going to award the contracts, we can enter that date here.\n\nThis field is optional, so we'll leave it blank for now since the date is yet to be decided. If we want to send daily emails reminding bidders of their due date, we can enable countdown emails, and choose how many days from the bid due date we want to start sending daily reminder emails to encourage companies to submit their bids. Let's choose 7 days so the bidders will be sent notification emails starting 7 days prior to the due date. Another setting we can enable is Accept Submissions Past Due Date if you want bidders to be able to submit bids within Procore past the specified due date, which may be necessary if you haven't received enough bids or if you want to give your bidders more flexibility.\n\nIf we do not enable, bidders will not be able to submit any bids within Procore after the due date. If we click on Enable Blind Bidding, all bid dollar amounts will be hidden from administrators until the due date has passed, though you will still see that the bid has been submitted. This setting helps ensure ethical bid practices. Next, we can Disable Electronic Submissions of Bids.\n\nWe will want to enable this setting for projects that do not allow bidders to submit bids electronically. Let's enable Include Bid Docs so that the bidders can access bid documents directly from the bid invitation email. It's recommended that you enable this setting because it will make it a lot easier for the bidders to access the required project documentation directly from the email. In other words, bidders do not have to log into Procore to access all the bid documents.\n\nLastly, the bid submission message is pulling data from the project level admin tools configurations. If we want to make any modifications for this specific bid, we can do so at this time. Once we have entered all the necessary general information for the package, let's click 'Create Bid Package'. Now, we'll attach the Drawings, Documents, and Specifications that we uploaded when we configured our project for bidding.\n\nFor the Drawings, let's select our bid set, and we can narrow it down further by discipline, and then select individual drawings. Next, we'll attach the Documents folder we configured specifically for bidding. Remember, if you select the Parent folder, all the subfolders and files will also be attached to the bid list. We'll attach relevant sections of the bid set to our spec book.\n\nAnd if the bid package only pertains to one division within the spec book, we can choose to only attach that specific division. Once we want the bidders to have access to all relevant documentation, we're going to include both the current set of drawings and specs. Once all of our files have been selected, Click 'Attach Files'. We can now see the Bidding tab within our bid package.\n\nWe can also see the Overview, Files, Correspondence, Download Log, and Change History. Once a bid package has been created, we can build out bid forms. For more information on bid packages, visit support. procore.\n\ncom.

If the company has included files with the bid package, such as relevant spec sections, drawings, and documents, we can go ahead and download them in a .zip file by clicking the Download button here. If we want to indicate whether or not we intend to bid on the project, we can submit our response here.\n\nNote that we can change this response before the due date if needed. Now let's go over how to submit our bid in Procore.\n\nIf you prefer to submit your bid via email without logging into Procore, you can reply directly to the bid invitation email with one or more files attached.\n\nAfter you send the email, the bid solicitor will see that you submitted a bid and can review the files that were attached to your email.\n\nLet's go ahead and click View in Procore to see how we can submit our bid through Procore's web application.\n\nNote that if this is your first time being added to Procore, you should receive a welcome to Procore email with a link to get started. The email address used for your bid invitation will be your username, and you'll need to create a secure password to log in with.\n\nIf we've been added to Procore before, we can go ahead and log in now.\n\nAfter logging in, we'll see the company's Planroom tool in Procore where we can review the bid sheet and related information, such as bid documents and emails. We see the same information that was listed on the email and have options to download or email the bid documents from the bid package, specify or change our intention to bid, and export the bid sheet. If we have questions for the bid solicitor, we can click the Contact button here to start an email, or go to the Emails tab to review any emails related to the bid. If the bid solicitor sends out an addendum or other change as a correspondence, it will show on the Correspondence tab.\n\nWhen we're ready to place our bid, we'll click Enter a Bid.\n\nWe can then enter an amount for each line item, and Procore will automatically calculate the total.\n\nIf we want to provide alternates, we can enter them here.\n\nIf we have any inclusions, exclusions, or comments, we can write them out in these sections.\n\nTo attach any supporting documents, we can go ahead and upload files to the Attachments section. If we're not ready to submit the bid yet, we can click Save for Later and return to the bid another time.\n\nWhen we are ready to officially submit the bid, we'll click Submit Bid.\n\nA message confirms that we've successfully submitted our bid, and the bid solicitor will be notified of our bid submission.\n\nIf they decide to award our bid and convert it to a contract in Procore, we'll receive an awarded contract email. Note that if we need to change anything on the bid before the due date passes, we can log back into Procore and click Edit to revise and resubmit our bid.\n\nFor additional resources on submitting a bid, check out the instructions for bidding section of the bid invitation email. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/bidding?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1391">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/12zui8l03v","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT3M","name":"Bidding: Configure Bid Settings","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/e164d874a06ae4acdf8aed113869b0ed.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/12zui8l03v","uploadDate":"2019-03-25T22:16:06.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: z_ARCHIVE video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/12a5246b343e45e0506bb37eef76b60af02f7c6e.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we're going to go over how to configure the projects bidding settings. Procore's Bidding tool allows you to give bidders access to the information they need without having to send them huge files via email or using a document sharing system. Instead, everything can be managed in Procore, where you'll have a detailed and complete record of the entire bid process. Keep all parties informed at all times by making necessary changes in real time to accommodate for last minute modifications to the plans, schedule or other types of addendums.\n\nWhat's especially convenient for the bidders is that they can reply directly to the bid invitation email, declaring their intention to submit a bid for the project and download attached bid documents without ever having to log into Procore. Bidders can also upload their bid directly into Procore, or you can do it on their behalf. From there you can create a contract directly from the winning bid. Before we dove into the bidding tool, let's configure a few bidding settings in the projects admin tool under tool configuration, click Bidding.\n\nHere we can set default verbiage for our bid package if we want to defer from the default language that is inherited from an account setting at the company level. Although you can customize these text for your project is necessary, we recommend consulting with your company's project administrator to make sure you're following your company's policies and standards. However, we do recommend that you keep this portion of the default text to remind bid invitees that if they have problems submitting a bid, they can contact Procore's support team for help instead of contacting you directly. The bid\n\nsubmission confirmation message text is displayed when a bid invitee submits a bid. Let's add a confirmation message since it's blank by default. The next step is to determine where the bid invitations will be sent from, with respect to a physical mailing address. We will leave the default company for your company's headquarters and will want to select project if you have a local or regional office location.\n\nLet's click Update to save our settings. Now let's navigate to the bidding tool and review the tool specific configuration settings. If we click configure bid settings, we will see the default settings for each bid package. You can create multiple bid packages for a project, but we'll cover this in more detail in the Create a Bid Package video.\n\nYou'll likely want to configure some of your bid settings to be specific for your project. Note that the setting to enable bidders to add additional line items to their bid sheets can only be configured here. Mark this box. If you want bidders to be able to add a cost code and bid on additional scope that was not assigned to them.\n\nPlease use this setting with caution because bidders could add a cost code that is not accounted for your budget. Once your bid package settings are configured, click Update and return to the bidding tool. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/bidding?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1396">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9utdtvhgt4","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M45S","name":"Bidding: Update and View a Bid Package","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/a4ee262008faae66005d0a1477e146d5.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9utdtvhgt4","uploadDate":"2020-10-20T20:49:39.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: z_ARCHIVE video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/9401655ed4bd91e35c15ba8ab8699161044ecac8.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we're going to go over how to update and view a bid package. Let's get started. So what happens when an addendum is issued while the project is out for bid? All you need to do is update the bid package by going to the documents tool and updating the bid package folder to include another addendum.\n\nLet's upload a new addendum. Make note of the big yellow warning banner, letting me know that we've updated something within the bid package and is asking if we want to update. Now that we've updated the bid package. We'll want to inform the bidders of the update in case they already downloaded the bid docs.\n\nWe can check to see if bidders have downloaded the bid box by clicking the download log. The best way to inform bidders is via the correspondent's sub tab. We'll click add new correspondence where we can send an email notification to all bidders with updated bid information. Any bidders who have not declined a bid will automatically be in the BCC Field.\n\nWe'll add the subject addendum number too and instructions the attached link for new addendum added and click Send. They will all get an email with the updated bid doc link. Once the emails have been responded to and all bids have been submitted, it's time to review them and select your winning bids. We can review bids from the bidders view within this package.\n\nWe can also use the filters, like if we want to only view companies who've submitted their bid. You can also group by intent to bid, submission status, cost codes or trades. You can click into the activity log to see any status changes, downloads, notes or emails performed by each company. This is a great time to verify that the bidders have downloaded any updates like addendums.\n\nYou can also add a note to a company in the bid list. From this view you can see who has submitted a bid as well as which companies indicated their intention to bid but failed to submit it before the deadline. In such cases, you may want to contact these companies to see if they had problems submitting their bid or if they mailed or emailed their bid instead of submitting it via Procore. If your contractor bids on the package outside of Procore, you can submit a bid on their behalf.\n\nLet's say Steve chose to email his bid to Elton directly so Elton can go into the bid list, view the specific company, and submit a bid on their behalf. Once Elton has decided who has the winning bid, he can convert it into a contract. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/bidding?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/destination?id=AW-880638328&amp;cx=c&amp;gtm=4e5ca1" nonce=""></script><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/destination?id=AW-1062027947&amp;cx=c&amp;gtm=4e5ca1" nonce=""></script><meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="A7vZI3v+Gz7JfuRolKNM4Aff6zaGuT7X0mf3wtoZTnKv6497cVMnhy03KDqX7kBz/q/iidW7srW31oQbBt4VhgoAAACUeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJEaXNhYmxlVGhpcmRQYXJ0eVN0b3JhZ2VQYXJ0aXRpb25pbmczIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzU3OTgwODAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZSwiaXNUaGlyZFBhcnR5Ijp0cnVlfQ==">
