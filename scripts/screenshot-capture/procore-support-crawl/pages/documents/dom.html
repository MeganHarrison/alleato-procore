To complete these actions in the project, you'll need admin permissions to the Documents tool or the appropriate granular permission enabled on your permission template. Let's start with renaming a file or folder in the project's Documents tool. From the folder structure on the left, you can right click on a folder and click rename to quickly rename it.\n\nClick ‘Done’ to confirm the changes. To rename a file in the same way you can right click on it from the center panel and then click ‘Rename’. Another option is to click the ‘Eye Icon’ to expand the information panel and then rename the file by clicking into the title field. Once you've entered the new name, click out of the field to save the changes.\n\nThe Information panel is also where you can edit the description of the file, manage permissions and tracking settings and set file tags. In the permissions section, you can see whether the selected file or folder is public or private. Public files and folders can be seen by anyone with read only permissions or higher to the Documents tool, while private files or folders can only be accessed by admin level users, users with the access private folders and files granular permission enabled on the permission template, and those added to the file or folders permissions list. To choose whether the file or folder is private or public mark or clear the checkbox next to make private.\n\nIt's important to note that when a folder is marked as private, all files or folders within that folder are also private. If the checkbox is unable to be clicked because of inherited permissions, you'll need to make its parent folder public before being able to change the setting. If you'd like to select certain individuals, permission groups or distribution groups who should also have access to the file or folder, click ‘Manage permissions’. Mark the checkbox next to the individuals or groups you want to add, then click ‘Update’.\n\nNote that you can go back into the permissions list at any time to add or remove who should have access to the file or folder. Now let's take a look at tracking. Tracking the file or folder means you will receive an email notification after an update occurs, such as a file being added to a folder or a new version of a file being uploaded. Any user with access to the Documents tool can choose to track a file or folder by marking the checkbox next to track this file or folder.\n\nIn addition, admin level users can choose to add individuals and groups to the tracking list to ensure they receive important updates. To add or remove users from the list, click ‘Manage Tracking’, mark the ‘Checkboxes’ next to the people or distribution groups you want tracking the file or folder and clear the checkboxes next to those who don't need to be notified. Click ‘Update’ to save the changes. Next, we'll look at the file tags.\n\nKeep in mind that tags are only available for files, so you'll need to be selected on a file and not a folder to see this section. File tags are a great way to make it easier to locate files in the project's Documents tool, since users will be able to use them as filters. Any tags that are already applied to the file are shown in this section. To create or select the tag to apply to the file click ‘Manage File Tags’.\n\nA list of previously created tags appear in the dropdown menu. You can select multiple tags from the list and remove them later if needed. To create a tag, type the tag name and then click ‘Add Tag’. Click ‘Set Tags’ to confirm the tag.\n\nNotice that the tags we just applied to the file are now listed here. If you decide you want to remove a tag, click ‘Manage File Tags’ again and click the ‘X’ to remove it. You can also clear all tags from a file by clicking this ‘X’. Be sure to click ‘Set Tags’ to confirm the changes.\n\nOther sections of the information panel allow you to view records and items associated with the file or folder. The download log provides a list of each time the document was downloaded from Procore, along with the name of the person and when they downloaded it. If you want to see what changes have been made to a document, click ‘Change history’. Any changes such as moving a file or checking it in or out are recorded in this window, in order to ensure data integrity.\n\nThe email section offers an area for users with access to the document to have correspondence related to the document. Any email sent to the unique email address listed here will be stored in the emails window for users to reference at any time. For files, there is also a related item section where you can add links to relevant items in the project. For example, you might want to associate a relevant meeting to this file.\n\nTo add a related item, you'll first need to select the type of item from the type menu. Any items of that type in the project will then populate in the description menu. Select the item you want to add a link to and the date field will be automatically filled in. Enter notes if you'd like to provide additional context on the attached item, then click ‘Add’.\n\nAfter a related item is saved, a link is added which allows users to navigate directly to that item in Procore.

It's important to note that you can also upload and view files in the Company Documents tool. This is where documents that are important to all projects, like safety forms, can be easily accessed, ensuring all field users have the most up to date company policies. You can upload the following file types from your mobile device to the Documents tool.\n\nPhotos, Microsoft Word documents, PDF files, Spreadsheets, and PowerPoint files. Alright, let's get started. In the Projects Documents tool, tap the folder you want to upload the file to, or tap the Plus icon to upload a file outside of a folder. Let's select a folder.\n\nTap the Plus icon, and then tap Upload Files. We can then tap Camera to take a new photo, tap Library to add photos from our photo library, or tap Files to select files from our mobile device. Let's tap Files. We'll now select the files we want to upload to this folder.\n\nWe can then toggle on or off whether we want to track these files and make them private. Now let's view the document. We can find the document we want to view by using search or tapping the folder the document is in. Note, if you see this Download icon, it means that tapping on this document will automatically download the file and store it in the Procore app's memory, making it accessible in Offline Mode.\n\nOnce you find the document, tap it. From here, you can scroll through the document, if it's multiple pages. We can then tap here for more options. Tap Versions to view previous versions of the document.\n\nYou can also tap Share to print or email the document. Then tap Information to learn more about the details of the document.

Whether you're on site or off site, this tool will keep you up to date with project documents. With Procore's Documents tool, you can access various project documents, including project plans, safety documents, lien waivers, and project specific reference documents. Upon opening the Documents tool, you'll notice the New Documents This Week section.\n\nIt's a good practice to check this section regularly to see if any documents related to your scope of work have been added or updated. Here, you'll find information such as the File Name, Location, Upload Date, and the uploaders Name. Clickable links allow you to access specific files or folders quickly. When dealing with numerous documents, the Search and Filter options become invaluable.\n\nFor instance, you might need to find an updated document uploaded by your Procore point of contact. You can also combine filtering with keyword searches if you remember part of the document's title. Clearing search results will reset your search, but keep your filter options intact. As a collaborator, frequently on the job site, you won't have time to log into Procore daily to check for document updates.\n\nInstead, you'll want to track individual files or entire folders. Tracking a folder will also track all of its subfolders and files. For example, we could track this folder to receive email notifications whenever these documents are updated. When you track a file or folder, you'll receive email notifications whenever a new version is uploaded.\n\nThese tracked items will appear in your Items You're Tracking section. To avoid overwhelming your inbox, you'll receive a consolidated summary email once a day. You'll be able to access detailed information about each file. You can download the most recent version, or previous versions, from the Version Log section.\n\nAlternatively, right click on the file in the file tree to quickly download it. To find additional documents, you can search for specific documents within folders, or add filters to refine your search. Don't forget to utilize Procore's mobile application. You can download and install the Procore app in just a few minutes.\n\nThen, when you're on site, you can easily access project documents from your mobile device. You've now learned how to efficiently find, view, and download current and older versions of documents in Procore. This knowledge will streamline your project documentation management, helping you stay organized and up to date.

Let’s go there. Marking this checkbox will make it so that every file you upload to the Documents tool will automatically be marked private. This might be useful if you’re planning on having the majority of your documents only available to your internal contacts with Admin permissions, and you can go back and mark any other documents as public later.\n\nHowever, I don’t recommend marking all of your documents private by default, as the Document tool is meant to be a collaborative tool where people can interact and get all of the documents they need to be successful on site. Now, let’s say you create the perfect folder structure in one project that you want to add to another project without having to do all the manual work again. What you can do is go to this section and copy the folder structure from any other project in your account. That way, you only have to build a folder structure once and you create consistency.\n\nYou can also edit the folders once they’re copied over too. In the permissions table, ‘None’ means the user will not see the tool at all. ‘Read only’ users will only be able to view and download files. I recommend giving external contacts like clients, subcontractors, and superintendents, ‘Standard’ permissions.\n\n‘Standard’ permissions allow users to upload files, create folders, and email all files from Procore that they have access to. Remember that you can hide folders and files individually, so just because ‘Read-only’ and ‘Standard’ users have access to the tool doesn’t mean that they have access to everything. ‘Admin’ users can delete, edit, upload, and have access to the configurations. Give project managers and project engineers this permission.\n\nAnd don’t forget to use Procore’s mobile application when you’re on the job site to conveniently access project documents from your mobile device.

To manage permissions for files and folders, you'll need admin level permissions on the projects documents tool, unless you have the set permissions granular permission enabled on your permission template. Users must have read only or higher permissions on the project's documents tool in order to view folders and files. If you want users to be able to upload files or folders, they will need standard level permissions on the documents tool.\n\nAdmin level users can manage file and folder permissions in addition to viewing and uploading documents. In the documents tool, you can also manage permissions for certain files and folders to control who has access to them. From the project level documents tool, let's select the folder we want to manage permissions for. Now, we'll click the info icon to open the information panel and select permissions.\n\nHere we can choose whether we want this folder to be public or private. To make the folder private, we can mark the checkbox next to make private. It's important to note that if a parent folder is marked as private, all files and folders in that folder will automatically become private as well. By default, private files and folders can only be accessed by admin level users or users who have the access, private folders and files granular permission enabled under permission template.\n\nHowever, we can also grant access to specific permission groups, distribution groups, or individual people. To do this, we'll click manage permissions under the Permissions section. As an example, let's say we want to give Sam Superintendent access to this folder. We’ll mark the checkbox by his name and click Update.\n\nNow he will be able to access this private folder regardless of whether he has read only or standard permissions. Thanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_3485">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uvfi447k05","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT4M55S","name":"Documents: Overview - Superintendent","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/e49f75a12ec280379c47641676024d88.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uvfi447k05","uploadDate":"2018-08-10T22:29:15.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: z_ARCHIVE video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/a9ad74e6915f7495ed1ed0499243a6c205f8edfe.m3u8","transcript":"Procore’s Documents tool is found in the Core Tools section in your project and is one of the most used tools in Procore. In this tool, you have unlimited storage for all of your project’s files. You can even store video files in here. In this video, you’ll learn how easy it is to access all project-related documentation using Procore’s Documents tool, as well as how to upload and track key files.\n\nWhen you first go to the Documents tool, you’ll see an overview of the items you’re tracking and any new documents that were uploaded to the Documents tool this week. It’s always a good idea to give this list a quick scan to see if any new documents were recently uploaded that may affect a scope of work relevant to you or the subcontractors on site. As you can see, the project manager has uploaded the building permit to the “Permits” folder this week. If you would like to view the file without finding it in your folder structure, which you can see here, you can click this link to take you to the folder, or you can click the link under “File Name” to go directly to the new file.\n\nWhen a project contains a lot of documents, you’ll find the search and filter options especially useful. For example, you can might want to find any recent MSDS files that were uploaded by Pat the project manager. When you search in the Documents tool, you’ll also be able to search the contents of any PDFs you upload. When you search, you’ll see a “context” column, which will show you a preview of the first sentence in the file that Procore found your key word.\n\nFor example, in this revision of the drawings, you can see the word “MSDS” was also found in some of the files. Click the “x” in the search bar to remove the keyword, but any selected filter options will be saved. To exit out of the search and filter results completely, click the Documents breadcrumb at the top of the page. Another way to find folders and files is by using the file tree on the left, which works just like the file system on your computer.\n\nExpand and contract folders until you get the file that you’re looking for. You may notice that some folders have padlock icons, which means they’ve been marked as ”private” and are only visible to ‘Admin’ users on the Documents tool or any other user that has been granted access. Under this folder, you’ll see all the files that have been uploaded into it. Let’s navigate to that same door specification that we just searched for at the beginning of this video.\n\nWhen we click on a file, we’ll be able to see basic information including the version number, description, file type, a date and timestamp of when it was uploaded, and by who, as well as a preview thumbnail that you can click on to view the file. You can see that this file has been marked as Private. This means that only Admins on the Documents tool and any selected Standard and Read Only users have access to view this file. Only the users with ‘Admin’ permissions on the Documents tool will be able to see the names of the users that have view access and can manage the permission list accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, the “File Tracking” section shows you how many users are tracking the file and receiving email notifications when updated versions of a file are uploaded into the project. Under the “Version Log,” you’ll have access to download any previously uploaded versions of the file. Anytime you see this icon in Procore, you’ll be able to click on it and download that item. It’s important to remember that when you view a file, you will always be taken to the most recently uploaded version of that file.\n\nAnd if you’re lucky, the person who uploaded the file may have added a helpful comment or note about the changes. Now let’s say you need to upload a newer version of this file. Click the Choose File button and browse your local filesystem for the updated door specs. You’ll have the option to leave a short summary of what changed in the new version.\n\nThen click Upload. The Version Log is a great way to access older versions, but as a superintendent, you’ll likely not have enough time to drill down into each individual file to see if it’s been updated recently. One of the most useful features for superintendents is the ability to track a file or folder, especially the ones that are periodically updated such as the project manual or the schedule folder, assuming you’ve integrated a project schedule like Microsoft Project or Primavera P6. Tracking key files and folders can help keep you well informed of changes in the project and save you time.\n\nThis is because when you track a file or folder in Procore, you’ll automatically receive notifications via email every time a tracked file or folder is added or updated in Procore. You can track an individual file, or you can track an entire folder. When you track an entire folder, you will receive an email that will list all of the files that were uploaded or updated in that folder, and when you track an individual file, you will only get an email if a new version of that file is uploaded. It’s important to keep in mind that you’ll only receive a file tracking summary email once per day since we don’t want to overwhelm your inbox.\n\nEach email contains links to the recently uploaded files, which can be used to access the files in Procore. Don’t forget that you’ll have easy access to all of your tracked files and folders from the “Items You’re Tracking” section we saw in the beginning of this video. The Documents tool keeps everyone up-to-date by giving team members access to the most recent project documents at all times and from any location. Now, you should be familiar with how to find, view, and download current and older versions of documents in Procore.\n\nThanks for watching!","hasPart":[{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":99,"name":"Search For and Apply Filters to a Project's Documents","startOffset":58,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=58s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":168,"name":"View a Document","startOffset":99,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=99s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":189,"name":"Download a Previous Version of a File","startOffset":168,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=168s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":202,"name":"Upload a New Version of a File","startOffset":189,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=189s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":294,"name":"Track File and Folder Changes","startOffset":202,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=202s"}]}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_3503">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/lnwvm1hn26","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT3M2S","name":"Documents: Upload and View Documents (Mobile) -

To manage permissions for files and folders, you'll need admin level permissions on the projects documents tool, unless you have the set permissions granular permission enabled on your permission template. Users must have read only or higher permissions on the project's documents tool in order to view folders and files. If you want users to be able to upload files or folders, they will need standard level permissions on the documents tool.\n\nAdmin level users can manage file and folder permissions in addition to viewing and uploading documents. In the documents tool, you can also manage permissions for certain files and folders to control who has access to them. From the project level documents tool, let's select the folder we want to manage permissions for. Now, we'll click the info icon to open the information panel and select permissions.\n\nHere we can choose whether we want this folder to be public or private. To make the folder private, we can mark the checkbox next to make private. It's important to note that if a parent folder is marked as private, all files and folders in that folder will automatically become private as well. By default, private files and folders can only be accessed by admin level users or users who have the access, private folders and files granular permission enabled under permission template.\n\nHowever, we can also grant access to specific permission groups, distribution groups, or individual people. To do this, we'll click manage permissions under the Permissions section. As an example, let's say we want to give Sam Superintendent access to this folder. We’ll mark the checkbox by his name and click Update.\n\nNow he will be able to access this private folder regardless of whether he has read only or standard permissions.

Let’s go there. Marking this checkbox will make it so that every file you upload to the Documents tool will automatically be marked private. This might be useful if you’re planning on having the majority of your documents only available to your internal contacts with Admin permissions, and you can go back and mark any other documents as public later.\n\nHowever, I don’t recommend marking all of your documents private by default, as the Document tool is meant to be a collaborative tool where people can interact and get all of the documents they need to be successful on site. Now, let’s say you create the perfect folder structure in one project that you want to add to another project without having to do all the manual work again. What you can do is go to this section and copy the folder structure from any other project in your account. That way, you only have to build a folder structure once and you create consistency.\n\nYou can also edit the folders once they’re copied over too. In the permissions table, ‘None’ means the user will not see the tool at all. ‘Read only’ users will only be able to view and download files. I recommend giving external contacts like clients, subcontractors, and superintendents, ‘Standard’ permissions.\n\n‘Standard’ permissions allow users to upload files, create folders, and email all files from Procore that they have access to. Remember that you can hide folders and files individually, so just because ‘Read-only’ and ‘Standard’ users have access to the tool doesn’t mean that they have access to everything. ‘Admin’ users can delete, edit, upload, and have access to the configurations. Give project managers and project engineers this permission.\n\nAnd don’t forget to use Procore’s mobile application when you’re on the job site to conveniently access project documents from your mobile device.

Whether you're on site or off site, this tool will keep you up to date with project documents. With Procore's Documents tool, you can access various project documents, including project plans, safety documents, lien waivers, and project specific reference documents. Upon opening the Documents tool, you'll notice the New Documents This Week section.\n\nIt's a good practice to check this section regularly to see if any documents related to your scope of work have been added or updated. Here, you'll find information such as the File Name, Location, Upload Date, and the uploaders Name. Clickable links allow you to access specific files or folders quickly. When dealing with numerous documents, the Search and Filter options become invaluable.\n\nFor instance, you might need to find an updated document uploaded by your Procore point of contact. You can also combine filtering with keyword searches if you remember part of the document's title. Clearing search results will reset your search, but keep your filter options intact. As a collaborator, frequently on the job site, you won't have time to log into Procore daily to check for document updates.\n\nInstead, you'll want to track individual files or entire folders. Tracking a folder will also track all of its subfolders and files. For example, we could track this folder to receive email notifications whenever these documents are updated. When you track a file or folder, you'll receive email notifications whenever a new version is uploaded.\n\nThese tracked items will appear in your Items You're Tracking section. To avoid overwhelming your inbox, you'll receive a consolidated summary email once a day. You'll be able to access detailed information about each file. You can download the most recent version, or previous versions, from the Version Log section.\n\nAlternatively, right click on the file in the file tree to quickly download it. To find additional documents, you can search for specific documents within folders, or add filters to refine your search. Don't forget to utilize Procore's mobile application. You can download and install the Procore app in just a few minutes.\n\nThen, when you're on site, you can easily access project documents from your mobile device. You've now learned how to efficiently find, view, and download current and older versions of documents in Procore. This knowledge will streamline your project documentation management, helping you stay organized and up to date.

It's important to note that you can also upload and view files in the Company Documents tool. This is where documents that are important to all projects, like safety forms, can be easily accessed, ensuring all field users have the most up to date company policies. You can upload the following file types from your mobile device to the Documents tool.\n\nPhotos, Microsoft Word documents, PDF files, Spreadsheets, and PowerPoint files. Alright, let's get started. In the Projects Documents tool, tap the folder you want to upload the file to, or tap the Plus icon to upload a file outside of a folder. Let's select a folder.\n\nTap the Plus icon, and then tap Upload Files. We can then tap Camera to take a new photo, tap Library to add photos from our photo library, or tap Files to select files from our mobile device. Let's tap Files. We'll now select the files we want to upload to this folder.\n\nWe can then toggle on or off whether we want to track these files and make them private. Now let's view the document. We can find the document we want to view by using search or tapping the folder the document is in. Note, if you see this Download icon, it means that tapping on this document will automatically download the file and store it in the Procore app's memory, making it accessible in Offline Mode.\n\nOnce you find the document, tap it. From here, you can scroll through the document, if it's multiple pages. We can then tap here for more options. Tap Versions to view previous versions of the document.\n\nYou can also tap Share to print or email the document. Then tap Information to learn more about the details of the document.

To complete these actions in the project, you'll need admin permissions to the Documents tool or the appropriate granular permission enabled on your permission template. Let's start with renaming a file or folder in the project's Documents tool. From the folder structure on the left, you can right click on a folder and click rename to quickly rename it.\n\nClick ‘Done’ to confirm the changes. To rename a file in the same way you can right click on it from the center panel and then click ‘Rename’. Another option is to click the ‘Eye Icon’ to expand the information panel and then rename the file by clicking into the title field. Once you've entered the new name, click out of the field to save the changes.\n\nThe Information panel is also where you can edit the description of the file, manage permissions and tracking settings and set file tags. In the permissions section, you can see whether the selected file or folder is public or private. Public files and folders can be seen by anyone with read only permissions or higher to the Documents tool, while private files or folders can only be accessed by admin level users, users with the access private folders and files granular permission enabled on the permission template, and those added to the file or folders permissions list. To choose whether the file or folder is private or public mark or clear the checkbox next to make private.\n\nIt's important to note that when a folder is marked as private, all files or folders within that folder are also private. If the checkbox is unable to be clicked because of inherited permissions, you'll need to make its parent folder public before being able to change the setting. If you'd like to select certain individuals, permission groups or distribution groups who should also have access to the file or folder, click ‘Manage permissions’. Mark the checkbox next to the individuals or groups you want to add, then click ‘Update’.\n\nNote that you can go back into the permissions list at any time to add or remove who should have access to the file or folder. Now let's take a look at tracking. Tracking the file or folder means you will receive an email notification after an update occurs, such as a file being added to a folder or a new version of a file being uploaded. Any user with access to the Documents tool can choose to track a file or folder by marking the checkbox next to track this file or folder.\n\nIn addition, admin level users can choose to add individuals and groups to the tracking list to ensure they receive important updates. To add or remove users from the list, click ‘Manage Tracking’, mark the ‘Checkboxes’ next to the people or distribution groups you want tracking the file or folder and clear the checkboxes next to those who don't need to be notified. Click ‘Update’ to save the changes. Next, we'll look at the file tags.\n\nKeep in mind that tags are only available for files, so you'll need to be selected on a file and not a folder to see this section. File tags are a great way to make it easier to locate files in the project's Documents tool, since users will be able to use them as filters. Any tags that are already applied to the file are shown in this section. To create or select the tag to apply to the file click ‘Manage File Tags’.\n\nA list of previously created tags appear in the dropdown menu. You can select multiple tags from the list and remove them later if needed. To create a tag, type the tag name and then click ‘Add Tag’. Click ‘Set Tags’ to confirm the tag.\n\nNotice that the tags we just applied to the file are now listed here. If you decide you want to remove a tag, click ‘Manage File Tags’ again and click the ‘X’ to remove it. You can also clear all tags from a file by clicking this ‘X’. Be sure to click ‘Set Tags’ to confirm the changes.\n\nOther sections of the information panel allow you to view records and items associated with the file or folder. The download log provides a list of each time the document was downloaded from Procore, along with the name of the person and when they downloaded it. If you want to see what changes have been made to a document, click ‘Change history’. Any changes such as moving a file or checking it in or out are recorded in this window, in order to ensure data integrity.\n\nThe email section offers an area for users with access to the document to have correspondence related to the document. Any email sent to the unique email address listed here will be stored in the emails window for users to reference at any time. For files, there is also a related item section where you can add links to relevant items in the project. For example, you might want to associate a relevant meeting to this file.\n\nTo add a related item, you'll first need to select the type of item from the type menu. Any items of that type in the project will then populate in the description menu. Select the item you want to add a link to and the date field will be automatically filled in. Enter notes if you'd like to provide additional context on the attached item, then click ‘Add’.\n\nAfter a related item is saved, a link is added which allows users to navigate directly to that item in Procore.

In this tool, you have unlimited storage for all of your project’s files. You can even store video files in here. In this video, you’ll learn how easy it is to access all project-related documentation using Procore’s Documents tool, as well as how to upload and track key files.\n\nWhen you first go to the Documents tool, you’ll see an overview of the items you’re tracking and any new documents that were uploaded to the Documents tool this week. It’s always a good idea to give this list a quick scan to see if any new documents were recently uploaded that may affect a scope of work relevant to you or the subcontractors on site. As you can see, the project manager has uploaded the building permit to the “Permits” folder this week. If you would like to view the file without finding it in your folder structure, which you can see here, you can click this link to take you to the folder, or you can click the link under “File Name” to go directly to the new file.\n\nWhen a project contains a lot of documents, you’ll find the search and filter options especially useful. For example, you can might want to find any recent MSDS files that were uploaded by Pat the project manager. When you search in the Documents tool, you’ll also be able to search the contents of any PDFs you upload. When you search, you’ll see a “context” column, which will show you a preview of the first sentence in the file that Procore found your key word.\n\nFor example, in this revision of the drawings, you can see the word “MSDS” was also found in some of the files. Click the “x” in the search bar to remove the keyword, but any selected filter options will be saved. To exit out of the search and filter results completely, click the Documents breadcrumb at the top of the page. Another way to find folders and files is by using the file tree on the left, which works just like the file system on your computer.\n\nExpand and contract folders until you get the file that you’re looking for. You may notice that some folders have padlock icons, which means they’ve been marked as ”private” and are only visible to ‘Admin’ users on the Documents tool or any other user that has been granted access. Under this folder, you’ll see all the files that have been uploaded into it. Let’s navigate to that same door specification that we just searched for at the beginning of this video.\n\nWhen we click on a file, we’ll be able to see basic information including the version number, description, file type, a date and timestamp of when it was uploaded, and by who, as well as a preview thumbnail that you can click on to view the file. You can see that this file has been marked as Private. This means that only Admins on the Documents tool and any selected Standard and Read Only users have access to view this file. Only the users with ‘Admin’ permissions on the Documents tool will be able to see the names of the users that have view access and can manage the permission list accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, the “File Tracking” section shows you how many users are tracking the file and receiving email notifications when updated versions of a file are uploaded into the project. Under the “Version Log,” you’ll have access to download any previously uploaded versions of the file. Anytime you see this icon in Procore, you’ll be able to click on it and download that item. It’s important to remember that when you view a file, you will always be taken to the most recently uploaded version of that file.\n\nAnd if you’re lucky, the person who uploaded the file may have added a helpful comment or note about the changes. Now let’s say you need to upload a newer version of this file. Click the Choose File button and browse your local filesystem for the updated door specs. You’ll have the option to leave a short summary of what changed in the new version.\n\nThen click Upload. The Version Log is a great way to access older versions, but as a superintendent, you’ll likely not have enough time to drill down into each individual file to see if it’s been updated recently. One of the most useful features for superintendents is the ability to track a file or folder, especially the ones that are periodically updated such as the project manual or the schedule folder, assuming you’ve integrated a project schedule like Microsoft Project or Primavera P6. Tracking key files and folders can help keep you well informed of changes in the project and save you time.\n\nThis is because when you track a file or folder in Procore, you’ll automatically receive notifications via email every time a tracked file or folder is added or updated in Procore. You can track an individual file, or you can track an entire folder. When you track an entire folder, you will receive an email that will list all of the files that were uploaded or updated in that folder, and when you track an individual file, you will only get an email if a new version of that file is uploaded. It’s important to keep in mind that you’ll only receive a file tracking summary email once per day since we don’t want to overwhelm your inbox.\n\nEach email contains links to the recently uploaded files, which can be used to access the files in Procore. Don’t forget that you’ll have easy access to all of your tracked files and folders from the “Items You’re Tracking” section we saw in the beginning of this video. The Documents tool keeps everyone up-to-date by giving team members access to the most recent project documents at all times and from any location. Now, you should be familiar with how to find, view, and download current and older versions of documents in Procore.\n\nThanks for watching!","hasPart":[{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":99,"name":"Search For and Apply Filters to a Project's Documents","startOffset":58,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=58s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":168,"name":"View a Document","startOffset":99,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=99s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":189,"name":"Download a Previous Version of a File","startOffset":168,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=168s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":202,"name":"Upload a New Version of a File","startOffset":189,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=189s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":294,"name":"Track File and Folder Changes","startOffset":202,"url":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/documents?wtime=202s"}]}</script><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/destination?id=AW-880638328&amp;cx=c&amp;gtm=4e5ca1" nonce=""></script><script type="text/javascript" async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/destination?id=AW-1062027947&amp;cx=c&amp;gtm=4e5ca1" nonce=""></script><meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="A7vZI3v+Gz7JfuRolKNM4Aff6zaGuT7X0mf3wtoZTnKv6497cVMnhy03KDqX7kBz/q/iidW7srW31oQbBt4VhgoAAACUeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJEaXNhYmxlVGhpcmRQYXJ0eVN0b3JhZ2VQYXJ0aXRpb25pbmczIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzU3OTgwODAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZSwiaXNUaGlyZFBhcnR5Ijp0cnVlfQ==">
