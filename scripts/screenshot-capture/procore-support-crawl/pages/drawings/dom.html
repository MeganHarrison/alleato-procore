We can also select it in the tool list, but tapping this button here is ideal, since it will be there no matter where we are in the app.\n\nThe first time we go to the Drawings tool, we might need to download the drawings before we can see them. This is so we can have complete control over our device's storage. Procore recommends that you download all of the drawings in the current set to your device, but if you don't want all of your project's drawings on your device's storage, you can choose to manually download the drawings you want.

Managing drawings and Procore as opposed to traditional printing and distribution methods, not only saves costs, but also ensures that your team always has access to the latest versions. In this video, we'll explore the features and best practices for navigating project drawings. Accessing drawings in Procore is a user-friendly process.\n\nUpon logging into Procore and selecting your project, you'll find the current set of drawings automatically displayed. Collaborators often prefer to subscribe to projects drawings, which adds them to an email distribution list, ensuring they receive updates whenever new drawings are uploaded. There are multiple viewing options for drawings. You can explore the List view, which provides details such as Discipline, Drawing Number, Title, Revision Number, Dates and Set Information.\n\nThese icons indicate whether a drawing has markups published on it or if there are any sketches that have been created related to the drawing. Additionally, the Thumbnails view will display all of the drawings in the set organized by discipline. Procore's responsive design ensures usability even on smaller screens with a convenience slider for table navigation. If you want to download any of the drawings, you will simply need to select the drawings and Export them as a list in PDF or CSV format, or you can Download the drawings according to your preferences here.\n\nIf you're on the thumbnails view, drawings can be Downloaded here. It is important to note that Procore doesn't recommend downloading the drawings since you'll always be able to view the drawings right in Procore even when you're offline and on the go in the field. You can manage drawings by beginning with an overview of all items with Filters that allow you to find specific drawings based on Set Name or Discipline. You can also Search in the search bar here to view a drawing.\n\nClick open. The full screen viewer allows you to zoom in and out with your mouse or these buttons and pan the drawing. While viewing, you can show or hide markups, including both the Personal and Published layers. Personal markups are visible only to you making them ideal for taking personal notes.\n\nThere are various ways to access link drawings. You can switch between drawings and revisions using menu options and arrows here. The search button is also another useful way to find the drawings you were looking for. Drawing links within the drawing itself provide seamless navigation between related drawings, making it easy to cross reference.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest changes, check the Activity section. New markups and updates are highlighted with an indicator ensuring that you're always aware of relevant changes. If you want to see more information about a drawing click Info. This displays details such as the Title, Number, and associated Dates providing valuable context for each drawing.\n\nTo learn more information about the drawing, click Go to Info Page. Here you can view related sketches, related items and emails for this drawing. While you can use a mobile device, viewing drawings on a computer provides the advantage of a larger screen. Use this option when you require detailed examination or comparison of drawings.\n\nProcore's Drawings tool offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for handling project drawings. You are able to streamline your drawing management process, stay informed about changes, and collaborate effectively with project teams.

Many collaborators save a lot of time when they have an unofficial question by simply showing their PM or superintendent a drawing with markups. Let’s take a look at how Paul uses the markup tool. In this case, Paul has marked up his drawing to accomplish two things, 1) to highlight areas on the drawing where changes have been made on the jobsite, and 2) to make personal notes to himself as he works.\n\nAlright, let’s start fresh and break down how he added each of those markups. You will have the ability to mark up a drawing on both your computer and in Procore’s app on your mobile device, so even though we’re showing this to you on a mobile device, you will see the same markup tools on Procore’s Drawings tool on the web. When you add a markup, it will be added to your personal layer, which only you can see. This makes drawings a great place to add personal notes and markups that you can use for reference as you work on site.\n\nYou might see other markups on drawings you didn’t add also. These are markups that have been added by the project’s Drawing administrators to share linked items, important notes, and changes to the drawing that everyone on the project needs to know. Let's hide all the published markups by using the filters and tapping the publish layer to hide it. Alright, let’s jump into adding markups.\n\nThis is your markup toolbar. In it you will see all of your different markup tools. The select tool lets you grab a point of a drawing and drag it around on the screen. You’ll want to remember that when you’re adding markups and want to drag the drawing around, you must to first tap this icon before you can adjust your view.\n\nAlso with this tool, you can zoom all the way out and swipe up to view older versions of drawings. Under the select tool is a section that will change depending on the tool that you’ve chosen. For example, when we tap the pen or highlighter tools to draw free form markups using a virtual highlighter or pen, you will see that you can choose to edit both the color and stroke of the line you draw with both tools. After you draw a shape, you’ll be able to move it around to the desired location if you need.\n\nOnce you get your line or shape in the right spot, you can link the line or shape to other related items in Procore such as an RFI, submittal, document, or observation. It’s important to note that you will not see all of these options if your project does not have items in those tools. If you need to redo the shape, you simply have to use the select tool to select the markup, delete it, and start again. The shape tool let you quickly create several predefined shapes.\n\nOnce you draw a shape, you’ll still be able to change its shape and location. As you can see, you can also link the shape to related items. The arrow and line tools let you create arrows and lines on the drawing. You’ll see line stroke and color options, and just like the shape tool, you can link the arrow or line to an item in procore.\n\nUse the Text tool to add a quick note anywhere on the drawing. Draw a text box, and then enter your message. You can even link an item to this text as well. Measure approximate distances on your drawing by first calibrating a known distance on the drawing, like a wall, then you can calculate distances and areas on your drawing.\n\nThis is extremely powerful if you need to estimate how large an area is. Use the pin tool to drop a pin and add a link to an existing item such as a punch list item, so you can reference a more precise location to find the related issue. Be sure to check Procore’s support site for the latest information on drawing markups.

Procore's Drawings tool combines them all into an organized up to date digital record, accessible anywhere, anytime. On desktop or mobile device, online, or offline.\n\nDrawings can be sorted by area to suit any project. Field conditions can be marked up And tasks like RFI's and Punch items can be created and assigned, all providing a clear picture of the state of the project for anyone that logs in. When drawing PDFs are uploaded, Procore automatically detects the drawing number and title, provides version control, categorizes each into disciplines that can be customized to your business, and hyperlinks drawings to each other wherever they're referenced.\n\nProgress photos, RFIs, punch items, submittals, documents, coordination issues, observations, and inspections can be linked directly into drawings while in the field or office.\n\nThis allows you to run your project right from the drawings, keeping the entire project team on the same page. Filter markups on or off to focus on the task at hand view the activity tab to see what's been red lined by who and search the text across all your drawings instantly.\n\nAs new revisions are updated in Procore, the current set of drawings is automatically updated. And if you're ever viewing an outdated version, a banner alerts you. So teams will always know whether or not they're working the most recent information.\n\nCompare revisions to each other or to another drawing, and Procore will highlight additions in blue and anything removed from the design in red. Procore is lightning fast, so you're never waiting for drawings to load when you need them. Sync your drawings to your mobile device so they're available in instantly, even when you don't have an internet connection.\n\nHaving drawings in Procore, allows the whole team to stay in sync. Project managers can manage drawings from pre construction closeout. Design teams can upload changes and respond to RFI's in context, and subcontractors can avoid rework by getting notified as soon as new revisions are published. And with everything in one system, from as built to submittals, close out as easy when it's time to wrap up. With Procore's Drawings tool, it's okay to leave the drawings in the trailer, you already have them in your pocket.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/drawings?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_3145">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M9S","name":"Drawings: Configure Drawing Settings","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/4046a06d706036990c881827357df2f7.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","uploadDate":"2017-11-14T22:33:10.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: Product Cert (en-us) video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8304c032c9529ccfe4695a35bb19a06ba240078c.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we'll cover how to configure drawing settings. In the Drawings tool, we'll start by clicking here. Now we can see all the available settings to configure.

Then we can mark this checkbox if we would like users with standard level access to the Drawings tool to be able to delete any published markups. With this setting, we can mark the checkbox to enable drawings by area on the project. Drawings by area is useful for projects with multiple buildings or areas.\n\nEnabling this feature will allow you to manage a current set of drawings for each location.

We'll have the same options to Edit, Rearrange. And Delete.\n\nLet's now navigate to the next page of settings. Here we can configure abbreviations for drawing disciplines. These abbreviation mappings will be used to autofill drawing disciplines when drawings are uploaded. We can click into any field to modify the information.\n\nNote, any changes made will only affect newly uploaded drawings. We also have the options to delete a discipline and add custom disciplines. Now let's go to the Permissions Table page. Here we can see each user's permission for the Drawings tool.\n\nWe can click on a user's name for more information.

To get there, tap the ‘Drawings tool’ in the navigation bar. You can also select it in the tool list. But tapping this button here is much easier since it will be there no matter where you are in the app.\n\nThe first time you go to the Drawings tool, you might need to download the drawings before you can see them. Procore does this to give you complete control over your device's storage. Procore recommends that you download all of the drawings in the current set to your device. But if you don't want all the project's drawings on your device of storage, simply select ‘Manual’ to only download those drawings which you specified.\n\nJust make sure the drawings you need to view while in the field are downloaded to your device before going offline. We find that most collaborators prefer to opt in to get notifications whenever new drawings are published to the project, so to always know they're working off the current set of drawings, which will save everyone time and money from rework. Plus, if you opt in to receive these notifications, you'll know exactly when to tap the ‘Sync button’ to update your drawings to the new versions. Otherwise, you might be tapping ‘Sync’ more than needed to be 100% sure you're looking at the current set before you start working.\n\nOn the drawings list page, you'll see the current set by default, but you can always view older sets by clicking here.

Let's say you wake up one morning and see a notification that one of the drawings you've been working off of has been updated with a new revision. Instead of opening the current drawing and trying to guess what's changed, you can tap this ‘Icon’ to see a comparison of the current drawing and any older versions.\n\nThings that have been added to the current drawing will appear in blue, and things that have been removed from the current drawing will appear in red. When you're in comparison mode, you can switch between drawings in the current set to view different drawings comparisons quickly.

If you come across a drawing that is not matching up correctly, you can always re-align the drawings until they sit right on top of each other so you can see the differences.\n\nYou can even compare two different drawings. Let's go back to viewing the drawing and its markups by clicking exit comparison. If you want to view the drawing without some or all of the markups, use the filters to turn on and off types of markup so you can focus on what you need on the drawing. This last icon here is the share menu.\n\nFrom here, you can print the drawing, open it in another application, email a project member a link to the drawing or email a screenshot of the drawing to someone outside of Procore.

When you add a markup, it will only be added to your personal layer, which only you can see. This makes drawings a great place to add personal notes and markups that you can use for reference as you work on site.\n\nSince this is a collaborative tool, you might also see other markups that have been added by the project's drawing administrators. Alright, let's open a drawing and jump into adding markups. This toolbar is where we can find all the different markup tools that we can use first. The Select tool allows us to grab a point of a drawing and drag it around on the screen.\n\nWe'll also need to use this tool anytime we want to select or edit a markup that we've added. Under the select tool is a section that will change depending on the tool that we've chosen. For example, we can select the Pen tool and then choose to edit both the Color and Stroke of the line that we draw. After we add a markup, we can move it or make changes if needed.\n\nWe can also link markups to other related items in Procore, such as an RFI or Submittal, where we can scan a QR code here to find a specific submittal link to a location or observation. It's important to note that the link feature is only available on certain markup tools, and the items available to link will depend on the project that you're in. If we want to copy an existing markup, we can use the select tool to select the markup and tap Copy. Next long press on the area of the drawing that we want the markup to be added, and then tap Paste.\n\nSimilarly, we can use the Duplicate option to quickly add the same markup, which we can then move around as needed. Note that we can also copy markups over to another drawing in the project by navigating to that drawing and tapping Paste. If we need to redo a markup, we can select it, tap Delete, and then add a new one. We can also use the Lasso tool to delete multiple markups at once.\n\nLet's take a look at some other markup tools. With the Shape tool, we can quickly add predefined shapes such as a cloud or oval. The Arrow and Line tools let us create arrows and lines on the drawing. The Text tool allows us to add a quick note anywhere on the drawing.\n\nNote that we can use the slider to adjust the text size if needed. With the Measure tool, we can add measurements by first calibrating a known distance on the drawing, like a wall, then we can calculate approximate distances and areas. This is extremely powerful if you need to estimate how large an area is. Lastly, we can use the Pin tool to link to an existing item, such as a Punch Item, so we have a reference of where the issue is.\n\nWe can also create new items or take Photos to add to pins as needed. When we're done adding markups, we'll want to publish any that we want others to see. We can publish them individually or use the Lasso tool to publish multiple markups at once. For the latest information on drawing markups, be sure to check Procore's support site.\n\nThanks for watching!","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/drawings?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_4637">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M9S","name":"Drawings: Configure Drawing Settings","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/4046a06d706036990c881827357df2f7.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","uploadDate":"2017-11-14T22:33:10.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: Product Cert (en-us) video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8304c032c9529ccfe4695a35bb19a06ba240078c.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we'll cover how to configure drawing settings.

Let's get started. From the Drawings tool, click Upload. Note that if your organization is using Drawing Areas for the project, you'll need to open the specific Drawing Area first.\n\nIn the Upload window, we can either click Attach Files to select a file, or drag and drop one or more files into this area. After the file has been added, click Attach. Note that Procore uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract and autofill the Drawing Number, Discipline and Title for each drawing. Next, select the set that these drawings belong to, or create a new set.\n\nWe can then enter the relevant dates for the Set Date, Default Drawing Date, and Default Received Date. These dates are optional and can be modified later if needed. Below this, we can review some advanced options. If our set has a Default Revision Number or Letter, we can enter it here.\n\nIf the drawing numbers contain revisions, we can click here to specify where the revision exists. Next, we can click Get From File Name if we want Procore to populate the number and title of an individual drawing based off its file name. Lastly, we can select the Applicable Drawing Language. For more information on these settings, hover over the question mark next to Advanced Options, then click Learn More.\n\nAfter reviewing all necessary information, click Process to begin the upload. We can track the status of the upload here, and once completed, we can hover over the upload and click Review. If our drawing upload contains eight or more sheets, we'll see this Help Procore Auto Label Your Upload window. Here we can verify that Procore has read the drawings correctly by selecting the correct number and title from the Drawing Number and Drawing Title dropdown menus.\n\nThen we'll click Confirm and Go to Review. We can see that the drawing has been split into individual sheets for review. For each sheet, there is a preview of the page and the General Information. If there's any information that did not populate as expected, click into the field to make the necessary changes.\n\nNow we'll confirm the drawings, which we can do a few different ways. First, we can review a single drawing, and click Confirm in the General Information section. Second, we can confirm multiple drawings at once if we hold the shift key, select the drawings, and click Confirm Selected. Finally, if we finished reviewing all drawings in the set, click Confirm All.\n\nThe confirmed drawings are now visible to Admin users in the drawings tool, but remain in an Unpublished status until they are manually published. Let's now publish the drawing set. When we click Publish, we have two options. If we Publish and Distribute All, the drawings are published and Procore will send an email notification and push notification to Drawings Log Subscribers.\n\nIf we click Publish All, the drawings are published without any notifications. Our new drawing set has now been published and is available for the team on the web and mobile devices. Note that if the newly published drawing set includes architectural drawings, we can automatically generate locations for this project here. For more information about generating locations, watch the Setting Up Locations video.\n\nThanks for watching!","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/drawings?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_4660">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M9S","name":"Drawings: Configure Drawing Settings","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/4046a06d706036990c881827357df2f7.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tbrxl8zdnq","uploadDate":"2017-11-14T22:33:10.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: Product Cert (en-us) video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8304c032c9529ccfe4695a35bb19a06ba240078c.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we'll cover how to configure drawing settings.

Let's open a drawing. Within a drawing, we can open the markup toolbar here. Note that you will only see tools that are enabled for this project.\n\nThe first set of tools we'll go over is the Pen and Highlight. With these tools, we can draw freehand shapes on the drawing. To draw a straight line, simply hold down the shift key on your keyboard as you draw. Once we've drawn our shape, we can use the Select tool to move the markup, publish the markup, attach an item to the markup, or delete the markup.\n\nNote that only we can see any markups made here unless they're published. Once published, the markups will be visible to anyone with access to the drawing. The next set of tools allows us to up the drawing with the chosen shape. We can change the color, thickness, and opacity of a shape here.\n\nOnce a shape is drawn, we can select it to move it, publish the shape, attach a related item like an RFI, submittal, observation, or delete the shape. After this, we have the Arrow and Line tools. Similar to shapes, select the tool and customize the look. Then add it to the drawing.\n\nUse the Select tool to adjust, publish, attach, or delete. Next, use the Text tool to add a quick note anywhere on the drawing. Draw a text box and then enter your message. Note that the font size and the color of the box can both be changed even after the markup is published.\n\nWe can also use the corners of the text box to adjust the size. When finished, publish the markup and/or attach related items. The next set of tools is the Measuring tools. Before using these tools, you'll need to calibrate the drawing.\n\nWe will find a location on the drawing with a known measurement and drag the calibration from one end to the other. Then we'll enter the length. We can then use the Distance, Area, and Freehand tools to assess various measurements on the drawing. Now we have the Drawing Link tool.\n\nThis enables us to draw shapes that will be linked directly to other drawing sheets. To draw symmetrical shapes, hold down the shift key. Then we will link a drawing. Now when another teammate views this drawing, they can click this item and see the linked drawing.\n\nThe next group of tools is Pins. Here we can add pins to link to items within available tools. Let's link a photo to this markup. We'll select the Photo Pin, then we can upload a file from our device or directly from the Procore Photos tool.\n\nOnce published, another teammate looking at this drawing will be able to select a pin and see the attached item. The last set of tools we'll cover allows us to select individual parts of the markup. With the Multi-select use a rectangular shape, or use Lasso for a freeform selection area. When an item, or items, are selected, we can move them around the drawing, publish them, copy, duplicate, or delete them if needed.\n\nWhile we're making markups to this drawing, the Drawing Markup Activity Feed here was being updated. This feed displays a chronological list of markups that were added to the drawing. In addition to the Activity Feed, we can Search throughout the drawing set and view the General Information of this drawing. The Filter Markup feature can be used to view or hide specific layers and markup types.\n\nNext, let's view the QR code for this drawing. This QR code can be printed and posted at job sites for teams to scan and open the drawing directly on their mobile device. We can also download the drawing directly here.

Let's get started. From the Drawings tool, click Upload. Note that if your organization is using Drawing Areas for the project, you'll need to open the specific Drawing Area first.\n\nIn the Upload window, we can either click Attach Files to select a file, or drag and drop one or more files into this area. After the file has been added, click Attach. Note that Procore uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract and autofill the Drawing Number, Discipline and Title for each drawing. Next, select the set that these drawings belong to, or create a new set.\n\nWe can then enter the relevant dates for the Set Date, Default Drawing Date, and Default Received Date. These dates are optional and can be modified later if needed. Below this, we can review some advanced options. If our set has a Default Revision Number or Letter, we can enter it here.\n\nIf the drawing numbers contain revisions, we can click here to specify where the revision exists. Next, we can click Get From File Name if we want Procore to populate the number and title of an individual drawing based off its file name. Lastly, we can select the Applicable Drawing Language. For more information on these settings, hover over the question mark next to Advanced Options, then click Learn More.\n\nAfter reviewing all necessary information, click Process to begin the upload. We can track the status of the upload here, and once completed, we can hover over the upload and click Review. If our drawing upload contains eight or more sheets, we'll see this Help Procore Auto Label Your Upload window. Here we can verify that Procore has read the drawings correctly by selecting the correct number and title from the Drawing Number and Drawing Title dropdown menus.\n\nThen we'll click Confirm and Go to Review. We can see that the drawing has been split into individual sheets for review. For each sheet, there is a preview of the page and the General Information. If there's any information that did not populate as expected, click into the field to make the necessary changes.\n\nNow we'll confirm the drawings, which we can do a few different ways. First, we can review a single drawing, and click Confirm in the General Information section. Second, we can confirm multiple drawings at once if we hold the shift key, select the drawings, and click Confirm Selected. Finally, if we finished reviewing all drawings in the set, click Confirm All.\n\nThe confirmed drawings are now visible to Admin users in the drawings tool, but remain in an Unpublished status until they are manually published. Let's now publish the drawing set. When we click Publish, we have two options. If we Publish and Distribute All, the drawings are published and Procore will send an email notification and push notification to Drawings Log Subscribers.\n\nIf we click Publish All, the drawings are published without any notifications. Our new drawing set has now been published and is available for the team on the web and mobile devices. Note that if the newly published drawing set includes architectural drawings, we can automatically generate locations for this project here. For more information about generating locations, watch the Setting Up Locations video.\n\nThanks for watching!","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/drawings?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_5751">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/7vp4h6szyj","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M7S","name":"Drawings: Upload Drawing Revisions","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/21a5be7a5c7159044f09d52ed0c8bfc1.jpg?image_crop_resized=640x360","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/7vp4h6szyj","uploadDate":"2020-06-30T22:57:01.000Z","description":"a CEDT Team: Product Cert (en-us) video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/22c425301c0411d6697664909fed0878c489a8ab.m3u8","transcript":"In this video, we'll learn about uploading, drawing revisions. By default, we'll always be looking at the project's current set of drawings. When uploading drawing revisions, the process is going to be the same as if we were uploading drawings for the first time.\n\nClick upload and attach the drawing. We can upload a drawing file from our computer, drag and drop files from our desktop, or upload a drawing file from the Documents tool in Procore. Next we'll wanna create a new set to designate that these drawings are now in the current set. Let's call this set revision set.\n\nSelect the day we got the drawings and add in the other information in this box. This time we might want to use some Advanced Options. For instance, let's say we would like Procore to automatically give drawings in this set a default revision number of 1a, then click Process. The pending drawing upload will appear here while it's processing in the backend.\n\nWhen the upload is done, click here to review. Procore will prompt us to verify that the optical character recognition has found the drawing number and title correctly on the sheet. If it has not, click the dropdown menus to select the correct value for the number and title. Click confirm and Go to Review.\n\nThe process for uploading a drawing revision is no different than uploading the initial set. Procore instantly recognizes the fact that we're uploading drawing revisions, and by default, we'll automatically increment the revision number by one. However, since we configured a different value in the advanced settings, that value will be used instead. Review the drawings as usual, and then publish the revised drawing set.\n\nProcore will automatically update the current set to point to the newest drawing revisions. If we ever want to delete a drawing upload, we can simply click the Trashcan icon next to the upload item and it will delete it from the project. Lastly, if we've uploaded a revision to architectural drawings that impacted locations, we can navigate back to the Current Drawings page and click here to edit locations.

Many collaborators save a lot of time when they have an unofficial question by simply showing their PM or superintendent a drawing with markups. Let’s take a look at how Paul uses the markup tool. In this case, Paul has marked up his drawing to accomplish two things, 1) to highlight areas on the drawing where changes have been made on the jobsite, and 2) to make personal notes to himself as he works.\n\nAlright, let’s start fresh and break down how he added each of those markups. You will have the ability to mark up a drawing on both your computer and in Procore’s app on your mobile device, so even though we’re showing this to you on a mobile device, you will see the same markup tools on Procore’s Drawings tool on the web. When you add a markup, it will be added to your personal layer, which only you can see. This makes drawings a great place to add personal notes and markups that you can use for reference as you work on site.\n\nYou might see other markups on drawings you didn’t add also. These are markups that have been added by the project’s Drawing administrators to share linked items, important notes, and changes to the drawing that everyone on the project needs to know. Let's hide all the published markups by using the filters and tapping the publish layer to hide it. Alright, let’s jump into adding markups.\n\nThis is your markup toolbar. In it you will see all of your different markup tools. The select tool lets you grab a point of a drawing and drag it around on the screen. You’ll want to remember that when you’re adding markups and want to drag the drawing around, you must to first tap this icon before you can adjust your view.\n\nAlso with this tool, you can zoom all the way out and swipe up to view older versions of drawings. Under the select tool is a section that will change depending on the tool that you’ve chosen. For example, when we tap the pen or highlighter tools to draw free form markups using a virtual highlighter or pen, you will see that you can choose to edit both the color and stroke of the line you draw with both tools. After you draw a shape, you’ll be able to move it around to the desired location if you need.\n\nOnce you get your line or shape in the right spot, you can link the line or shape to other related items in Procore such as an RFI, submittal, document, or observation. It’s important to note that you will not see all of these options if your project does not have items in those tools. If you need to redo the shape, you simply have to use the select tool to select the markup, delete it, and start again. The shape tool let you quickly create several predefined shapes.\n\nOnce you draw a shape, you’ll still be able to change its shape and location. As you can see, you can also link the shape to related items. The arrow and line tools let you create arrows and lines on the drawing. You’ll see line stroke and color options, and just like the shape tool, you can link the arrow or line to an item in procore.\n\nUse the Text tool to add a quick note anywhere on the drawing. Draw a text box, and then enter your message. You can even link an item to this text as well. Measure approximate distances on your drawing by first calibrating a known distance on the drawing, like a wall, then you can calculate distances and areas on your drawing.\n\nThis is extremely powerful if you need to estimate how large an area is. Use the pin tool to drop a pin and add a link to an existing item such as a punch list item, so you can reference a more precise location to find the related issue. Be sure to check Procore’s support site for the latest information on drawing markups.

To get there, tap the ‘Drawings tool’ in the navigation bar. You can also select it in the tool list. But tapping this button here is much easier since it will be there no matter where you are in the app.\n\nThe first time you go to the Drawings tool, you might need to download the drawings before you can see them. Procore does this to give you complete control over your device's storage. Procore recommends that you download all of the drawings in the current set to your device. But if you don't want all the project's drawings on your device of storage, simply select ‘Manual’ to only download those drawings which you specified.\n\nJust make sure the drawings you need to view while in the field are downloaded to your device before going offline. We find that most collaborators prefer to opt in to get notifications whenever new drawings are published to the project, so to always know they're working off the current set of drawings, which will save everyone time and money from rework. Plus, if you opt in to receive these notifications, you'll know exactly when to tap the ‘Sync button’ to update your drawings to the new versions. Otherwise, you might be tapping ‘Sync’ more than needed to be 100% sure you're looking at the current set before you start working.\n\nOn the drawings list page, you'll see the current set by default, but you can always view older sets by clicking here. Quickly find your drawings by filtering, by discipline, or by scrolling to the discipline you want to view. On Paul's mobile device, he always prefers to view drawings as thumbnails since he can see more drawings at once, but if you prefer, you can view drawings as a list by tapping here. All right.\n\nLet's tap into a drawing with markups. You can tell which drawings have markups by these icons here, which will appear on all drawings with markups. The other icon you'll see is the sketches icon, which indicates that there are sketches associated with this drawing. Now that you're looking at the actual drawing, you can do a few things.\n\nYou can quickly jump to other drawings in the set Your viewing by tapping here, to view recently view drawings or tapping the ‘Left and Right Arrows’ to toggle between other drawings. If your team attached any items to this drawing like punch list items or RFIs specific to a place on the drawing, you can view them here, next to the drawings information icon. Let's say you wake up one morning and see a notification that one of the drawings you've been working off of has been updated with a new revision. Instead of opening the current drawing and trying to guess what's changed, you can tap this ‘Icon’ to see a comparison of the current drawing and any older versions.\n\nThings that have been added to the current drawing will appear in blue, and things that have been removed from the current drawing will appear in red. When you're in comparison mode, you can switch between drawings in the current set to view different drawings comparisons quickly. Toggle sheets to view one drawing at a time and in toggling to go back to viewing the drawing. If you come across a drawing that is not matching up correctly, you can always re-align the drawings until they sit right on top of each other so you can see the differences.\n\nYou can even compare two different drawings. Let's go back to viewing the drawing and its markups by clicking exit comparison. If you want to view the drawing without some or all of the markups, use the filters to turn on and off types of markup so you can focus on what you need on the drawing. This last icon here is the share menu.\n\nFrom here, you can print the drawing, open it in another application, email a project member a link to the drawing or email a screenshot of the drawing to someone outside of Procore. You can also remove the drawing from your device's storage if you don't need to view it on your mobile device. Remember that you can view all of the drawings that you have saved your device in your Procore application while offline. So if your job site is in a remote area or doesn't have WIFI or internet service, you can always have your project informationin your pocket.\n\nThanks for watching.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://es.support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/drawings?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_5884">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mckyg03fah","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT3M45S","name":"Drawings: Mark Up Drawings (Mobile) -

<p dir="ltr">La herramienta Planos tiene dos nuevas acciones para las anotaciones: ¡copiar y duplicar! <strong>Copiar</strong> guarda las anotaciones en el portapapeles para que pueda pegarlas en un plano <em>diferente</em> . Si ambos planos tienen las mismas dimensiones, la anotación se pega automáticamente en las mismas coordenadas que el plano original. <strong>Duplicar </strong>crea un duplicado de la anotación y lo pega cerca del original en el <em>mismo</em> plano, para que pueda moverlo a la ubicación deseada dentro del plano. Seleccionar más de una anotación a la vez le permite realizar estas acciones de forma masiva. Encuentre estos nuevos botones en el menú que aparece cuando hace clic en una anotación y comience a acelerar su proceso de anotación hoy mismo.
