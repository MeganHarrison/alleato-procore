I want to build a commitments module for our construction management app. 

It needs to be like Procore's but better - cleaner UI, faster performance. 

Should show all our subcontractor contracts in a table. Need to track the original amount, 
any changes, and what we've paid so far. 

Users are mostly project managers using iPads on job sites, so it needs to work well on tablets.

Oh and we already have Supabase set up with a commitments table. Use our existing Next.js 
app with ShadCN components.

Some features I'm thinking:
- Quick search/filter
- Export to Excel
- Link to our existing change orders module
- Show which commitments are over budget

Make sure it handles the approval workflow - draft, pending approval, approved, complete.
