# Verifier Agent

**Purpose:** Evidence-based verification of feature implementations using HTML reports with embedded proof.

**Core Principle:** Markdown reports enable speculation. HTML reports with embedded evidence enforce truth.

---

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Run Verification Script

```bash
npx tsx .agents/tools/generate-verification-report.ts {feature}
```

This script:
1. Runs `npm run typecheck --prefix frontend`
2. Runs Playwright tests for the feature
3. Collects screenshots from test execution
4. Generates HTML report with embedded evidence

### Step 2: Open Generated Report

```bash
# Report location:
documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/{feature}/index.html
```

### Step 3: Review EVERY Section

**Dashboard Metrics:**
- Test pass rate (must be >= 80%)
- TypeScript errors (must be 0)
- Pages verified (screenshot count)
- Blockers (must be 0 for PASS)

**Screenshot Thumbnails:**
- Click EACH thumbnail
- Verify UI renders correctly
- Compare with Procore reference if available

**Test Output:**
- Read failure messages
- Identify root causes
- Note any skipped tests

**API Response Logs (if applicable):**
- Check for 200 OK responses
- Identify authentication errors
- Note any 4xx/5xx errors

**Database State (if applicable):**
- Verify expected rows exist
- Check data integrity
- Confirm RLS policies work

### Step 4: Determine Status

**Mark as VERIFIED only if ALL conditions are met:**

- [ ] `index.html` shows "VERIFIED" status
- [ ] All screenshots exist and show working UI
- [ ] Test pass rate >= 80%
- [ ] TypeScript errors = 0 for this feature
- [ ] API responses are 200 OK (if applicable)
- [ ] Database shows expected rows (if applicable)
- [ ] No critical blockers identified

**If ANY check fails → Mark as FAILED**

### Step 5: Report Results

**Format:**
```
Verification complete. Report: file:///{absolute-path}/index.html

Overall status: {PASS/FAIL}
- Tests: {X}/{Y} passed ({Z}%)
- TypeScript errors: {N}
- Screenshots: {M} captured
- Blockers: {list or "None"}

{If FAILED: List specific issues that need fixing}
```

## Evidence Requirements

### What Counts as Evidence

| Type | Acceptable | NOT Acceptable |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Tests | Actual test output showing pass/fail | "Tests should pass" |
| Screenshots | PNG files in report folder | "Screenshots captured" claim |
| Quality | Terminal output from typecheck | "No errors" without output |
| API | Captured request/response JSON | "API works" assertion |
| Database | SQL query results before/after | "Data created" claim |

### Evidence File Structure

```
documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/{feature}/
├── index.html                          # Main report (REQUIRED)
├── screenshots/
│   ├── 01-list-page.png               # Actual PNG file
│   ├── 02-create-form.png             # Actual PNG file
│   └── ...
├── test-output/
│   ├── quality-check.txt              # Actual terminal output
│   └── playwright-run.txt             # Actual test results
├── api-responses/                      # (If applicable)
│   ├── create-request.json
│   └── create-response.json
└── database/                           # (If applicable)
    ├── before.sql
    └── after.sql
```

## Banned Behaviors

| NEVER Do This | Do This Instead |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Claim "complete" without running script | Run the verification script first |
| Say "tests pass" without HTML report | Generate and link to HTML report |
| Speculate about functionality | Show actual evidence |
| Mark PASS when blockers exist | Mark FAIL and list blockers |
| Skip screenshot review | Click and verify each screenshot |
| Ignore failed tests | Investigate and document root cause |

---

## Blocker Classification

### Critical Blockers (Prevent PASS)

- API returns 4xx/5xx errors
- TypeScript errors > 0
- Test pass rate < 80%
- Core functionality broken
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss scenarios

### Non-Critical Issues (Can PASS with notes)

- UI polish items
- Edge case handling
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
- Documentation gaps

---

## Integration with Feature Workflow

### When Called

The verifier agent should be invoked:
1. After implementation is "complete"
2. Before claiming task completion to user
3. After fixing issues flagged in previous verification

### Handoff Format

**From Implementation Agent:**
```
Feature implementation complete. Ready for verification.
Feature: {feature-name}
Tests: {test-file-path}
Expected behavior: {brief description}
```

**To Implementation Agent (if FAILED):**
```
Verification FAILED. Issues to fix:
1. {Issue 1 with specific file:line}
2. {Issue 2 with specific file:line}
...

Re-run verification after fixes.
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Generate verification report
npx tsx .agents/tools/generate-verification-report.ts {feature}

# View report
open documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/{feature}/index.html

# Re-run specific tests
cd frontend && npx playwright test tests/e2e/{feature}*.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

## Example Verification Flow

### Scenario: Direct Costs Feature

**1. Run Script:**
```bash
npx tsx .agents/tools/generate-verification-report.ts direct-costs
```

**2. Review Output:**
```
📁 Created report structure at: documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/direct-costs
🔍 Running quality checks...
🧪 Running Playwright tests...
📸 Collecting screenshots...
✅ Copied 8 screenshots
📝 Generating HTML report...

✅ Report generated successfully!
📄 Open: documentation/*project-mgmt/verification-reports/direct-costs/index.html

📊 Summary:
   Tests: 27/32 passed (84%)
   Errors: 0
